It is a cut-down version of our internal documentation, used at PagerDuty for any major incidents, and to prepare new employees for on-call responsibilities. It provides information not only on preparing for an incident, but also what to do during and after. It is intended to be used by on-call practitioners and those involved in an operational incident response process (or those wishing to enact a formal incident response process). See the \nabout page\n for more information on what this documentation is and why it exists.\n\n\n\n\nDon't know where to start?\n\n\nIf you're new to incident response and don't yet have a formal process in your organization, we recommend looking at our \nGetting Started\n page for a quick list of things you can do to begin, and our \nTraining Course\n page for a more detailed overview of our process.\n\n\n\n\nBeing On-Call\n#\n\n\nIf you've never been on-call before, you might be wondering what it's all about.

            "text": "Credit: \nBreakingpic @ Pexels\n\n\nIf you don't yet have a process in your own organization, or if you're just starting out, you may find the sheer quantity of information in this documentation overwhelming. It's important to remember that this \nisn't something you'll be able to implement overnight\n. It's a process that should be built up over time. While it took us years to get to this point, our hope is that you can make use of this documentation to skip some of the awkward growing pains we went through, and reach a more mature incident response process in the most efficient way possible.\n\n\nTo that end, we've put together this \"Getting Started\" guide to help you navigate the most important parts of our process, and provide some guidelines about which bits we think you should start with. If you're just starting out with your own incident response process, this is a great way to know what order we think you should do things in.\n\n\nDefine what an \"Incident\" and \"Major Incident\" are for you.\n#\n\n\nYou don't have to use \nour definitions\n, they're just a starting point. Feel free to come up with whatever you want. The point is that the definition should be a short, simple statement that makes sure everyone is on the same page. You want to remove any discussion around whether something is an incident or not during your response process. If you have a metric to use (e.g. \"if errors go above 100/minute it's a major incident\"), that's great. If not, don't let that stop you from defining what a Major Incident is.\n\n\nThe reason this should be your first step is because you can't respond to an incident until you know what an incident is. If one person considers something an incident but the rest of the organization doesn't, that's going to create ambiguity and confusion during any sort of incident response. Having a clear definition that's disseminated to your entire organization makes sure that everyone has the same understanding and prevents any confusion.\n\n\n\n\nWhat about Severity Levels?\n\n\nYou shouldn't need to worry about \"Severity Levels\" at the beginning. Just whether something is an incident or not. You can add severity levels later once you want to flesh out your response process more.\n\n\n\n\nDetermine how you will mobilize responders.\n#\n\n\nWhat is going to trigger your incident response process? Will it be an automated alert tied to a metric? That's a great place to start! Even if it's just a single alert that goes out to a group of responders.\n\n\n\n\nHave a way to manually trigger incident response\n\n\nHaving a way for humans to manually trigger incident response when they see something wrong will help to improve your response times. It took us a while to do this, but if we could go back in time we'd do this from the start!\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to set up a phone bridge and chat room dedicated for incident response. You want to prepare this in advance, and make sure the numbers and connection information are written down and shared with anyone who may need to respond. You don't want to be setting up the call and chat room while trying to respond to an incident. You should make the call and room names static or as easily discoverable as possible.\n\n\nYou also want to \nset expectations for your responders\n. Make sure they know that they need to join the call and chat room if they get paged and that they shouldn't just jump into solving the problem.\n\n\nFinally, you want to make sure your \nalerts are actionable\n. There's nothing worse than waking everyone up for something you cannot control. Make sure anything that is going to trigger your incident response and page people is something that requires \nimmediate human action\n to resolve.\n\n\nDefine the incident response roles.\n#\n\n\nYou only care about the \nIncident Commander\n role to begin with. If you have enough people you can also have a \nScribe\n. But to start with, just have an Incident Commander and your responders. The Incident Commander shouldn't be taking any remediation actions at all, they should just be leading the response and making the decisions. You don't need to follow the entire \ntraining guide\n to begin with, just the basics of asking questions and assigning tasks are enough to get you started.\n\n\nCreate a post-mortem template.\n#\n\n\nYou can use \nour template\n to get started, or come up with your own version. Just make sure that you have a structured template so that it makes it easier to compare incidents to each other. It can be as simple as three headings to begin with: \"What happened?\", \"Why did it happen?\", \"How are we going to make sure it doesn't happen again?\". Adding more detailed fields and information can come later.\n\n\n\n\nName Doesn't Matter\n\n\nYou don't need to call them \"post-mortem\"'s. After-action review, learning review, retrospective, etc. are all valid names. The point is that you review what happened and learn from it, the name you give to the process doesn't really matter.\n\n\n\n\nPractice\n#\n\n\nRun a fake incident, mobilize your responders, and have someone act as the Incident Commander. Get used to the switch from normal day-to-day operations, and the emergency operations of an incident. Switching to having an Incident Commander running the show can be jarring at first, so it helps to practice it in a low-risk situation to begin with. Playing a game of \"\nKeep Talking and Nobody Explodes\n\" is a light-hearted way of practicing the skills required for incident response. You can also run your own version of \nFailure Friday\n, where you manually inject some failure into your system and treat it as a major incident.\n\n\nUse it for a real incident.\n#\n\n\nOnce you've got the basics in place, start using the process for a real incident. The more you use it, the more natural it will become. As you use it more and more, you can add more process into it and tweak it for your needs. Things may not go smoothly the first time, but don't give up!\n\n\nWhat comes next?\n#\n\n\nYou can now start expanding your process and adding some more things. Here are our recommendations for the next things you should incorporate:\n\n\nAdd a scribe, if you haven't already.\n#\n\n\nKeeping an accurate timeline of events becomes really important when you want to go back and review your incidents. \nScribe\n should be the next role you start using.\n\n\nExpand your IC rotation.\n#\n\n\nYou don't want to just have a single IC, you want as many as you can get. Start training up more people and create an on-call rotation for it. At first, you will probably use weekly rotations. We recommend trying to get to a daily rotation as quickly as you can.\n\n\nAdd in a deputy as a role.\n#\n\n\nOnce you have a few more IC's, start adding a deputy to your response. Having a \nDeputy\n will give you the ability to quickly handover in longer incidents, and also gives the IC some backup for shorter incidents.\n\n\nDefine severity levels.\n#\n\n\nOnce you have the process working well, you can start to add more granularity to your response and incident definitions. Perhaps you don't want to do a \"full\" response for certain incidents. Define some \nseverity levels\n to document the level of response you want.\n\n\nStart adding other roles.\n#\n\n\nAs your process becomes more established, you want to start adding other roles. We recommend a \nCustomer Liaison\n as the next one you include.\n\n\nPractice, practice, practice.\n#\n\n\nIt cannot be overstated how much it helps to practice your incident response. If you trigger incident response and realize it's not really an incident, treat it as one anyway. You've already mobilized your responders, so it's free practice.\n\n\nDefine a process for larger incidents.\n#\n\n\nWe call these \nComplex Incidents\n. You won't use this often, but you'll want the phone bridge numbers and chat rooms prepared ahead of time. You'll also want to make sure your responders are aware of the process.",

            "text": "There are several main roles for our incident response teams at PagerDuty. Certain roles only have one person per incident (e.g. IC), whereas other roles can have multiple people (e.g. Subject Matter Expert, SME). It's all about coming together as a team, working the problem, and getting a solution quickly.\n\n\nHere is a rough outline of our role hierarchy, with each role discussed in more detail on the rest of this page.\n\n\n\n\nDuring larger complex incidents, the role structure may be adjusted to account for the creation of sub-teams. Read about how we handle \ncomplex incidents\n for more information.\n\n\n\n\nFlexible Structure\n\n\nIt is not intended that every role be filled by a different person for every incident. For example, if the incident is small enough in scope, the Deputy might also take on the responsibilities of the Scribe and Internal Liaison for that specific incident. The structure should be flexible and scale based on the size and scope of the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncident Commander (IC)\n#\n\n\nWhat is it?\n#\n\n\nAn Incident Commander acts as the single source of truth of what is currently happening and what is going to happen during an major incident. They come in all shapes, sizes, and colors.\n\n\nWhy have one?\n#\n\n\nAs any software system grows in size and complexity, things break and cause incidents. The Incident Commander is needed to help drive major incidents to resolution.\n\n\nWhat are the responsibilities?\n#\n\n\n\n\nHelp prepare for major incidents,\n\n\nSetup communications channels for major incidents.\n\n\nFunnel people to these communications channels when there is a major incident.\n\n\nTrain team members on how to communicate during major incidents and train other Incident Commanders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrive major incidents to resolution,\n\n\nGet everyone on the same communication channel.\n\n\nCollect information from team members for their services/area of ownership status.\n\n\nCollect proposed repair actions, then recommend repair actions to be taken.\n\n\nDelegate all repair actions, the Incident Commander is NOT a resolver.\n\n\nBe the single authority on system status\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost Mortem,\n\n\nCreating the initial template right after the incident so people can put in their thoughts while fresh.\n\n\nAssigning the post-mortem after the event is over, this can be done after the call.\n\n\nWork with Team Leads/Managers on scheduling preventive actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho are they?\n#\n\n\nAnyone on the Incident Commander on-call schedule. Trainees are typically on the Incident Commander Shadow schedule.\n\n\nHow can I become one?\n#\n\n\nTake a look at our \nIncident Commander training guide\n.\n\n\n\n\nDeputy\n#\n\n\nWhat is it?\n#\n\n\nA Deputy is a direct support role for the Incident Commander. This is not a shadow where the person just observes, the Deputy is expected to perform important tasks during an incident.\n\n\nWhy have one?\n#\n\n\nIt's important for the IC to focus on the problem at hand, rather than worrying about documenting the steps or monitoring timers. The deputy helps to support the IC and keep them focussed on the incident.\n\n\nWhat are the responsibilities?\n#\n\n\nThe Deputy is expected to:\n\n\n\n\nBring up issues to the Incident Commander that may otherwise not be addressed (keeping an eye on timers that have been started, circling back around to missed items from a roll call, etc).\n\n\nBe a \"hot standby\" Incident Commander, should the primary need to either transition to a SME, or otherwise have to step away from the IC role.\n\n\nManage the incident call, and be prepared to remove people from the call if instructed by the Incident Commander.\n\n\n\n\nWho are they?\n#\n\n\nAny Incident Commander can act as a deputy. Deputies need to be trained as an Incident Commander as they may be required to take over command.\n\n\nHow can I become one?\n#\n\n\nTake a look at our \nDeputy training guide\n. Deputies also need to be \ntrained as an Incident Commander\n.\n\n\n\n\nScribe\n#\n\n\nWhat is it?\n#\n\n\nA Scribe documents the timeline of an incident as it progresses, and makes sure all important decisions and data are captured for later review.\n\n\nWhy have one?\n#\n\n\nThe incident commander will need to focus on the problem at hand, and the subject matter experts will need to focus on resolving the incident. It is important to capture a timeline of events as they happen so that they can be reviewed during the post-mortem to determine how well we performed, and so we can accurately determine any additional impact that we might not have noticed at the time.\n\n\nWhat are the responsibilities?\n#\n\n\nThe Scribe is expected to:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure the incident call is being recorded.\n\n\nNote in Slack important data, events, and actions, as they happen. Specifically:\n\n\nKey actions as they are taken (Example: \"prod-server-387723 is being restarted to attempt to remove the stuck lock\")\n\n\nStatus reports when one is provided by the IC (Example: \"We are in SEV-1, service A is currently not processing events due to a stuck lock, X is restarting the app stack, next checkin in 3 minutes\")\n\n\nAny key callouts either during the call or at the ending review (Example: \"Note: (Bob B) We should have a better way to determine stuck locks.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho are they?\n#\n\n\nAnyone can act as a scribe during an incident, and are chosen by the Incident Commander at the start of the call. Typically the Deputy will act as the Scribe, but that doesn't necessarily need to happen, and for larger incidents may not be possible.\n\n\nHow can I become one?\n#\n\n\nFollow our \nScribe training guide\n, and then notify the Incident Commanders that you would like to be considered for scribing for the next incident.\n\n\n\n\nSubject Matter Expert\n#\n\n\nWhat is it?\n#\n\n\nA Subject Matter Expert (SME), sometimes called a \"Resolver\", is a domain expert or designated owner of a component or service that is part of the PagerDuty software stack.\n\n\nWhy have one?\n#\n\n\nThe IC and deputy are not all-knowing super beings. When there is a problem with a service, an expert in that service is needed to be able to quickly help identify and fix issues.\n\n\nWhat are the responsibilities?\n#\n\n\n\n\nBeing able to diagnose common problems with the service.\n\n\nBeing able to rapidly fix issues found during an incident.\n\n\nConcise communication skills, specifically for CAN reports:\n\n\nCondition: What is the current state of the service? Is it healthy or not?\n\n\nActions: What actions need to be taken if the service is not in a healthy state?\n\n\nNeeds: What support does the resolver need to perform an action?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho are they?\n#\n\n\nAnyone who is considered a \"domain expert\" can act as a resolver for an incident. Typically the service's primary on-call will act as the SME for that service.\n\n\nHow can I become one?\n#\n\n\nTake a look at our \nSubject Matter Expert training guide\n. You should also discuss with your team and service owner to determine what the requirements are for your particular service.\n\n\n\n\nCustomer Liaison\n#\n\n\nWhat is it?\n#\n\n\nA person responsible for interacting with customers, either directly, or via our public communication channels. Typically a member of the Customer Support team.\n\n\nWhy have one?\n#\n\n\nAll of the other roles will be actively working on identifying the cause and resolving the issue, we need a role which is focused purely on the customer interaction side of things so that it can be done properly, with the due care and attention it needs.\n\n\nWhat are the responsibilities?\n#\n\n\n\n\nPost any publicly facing messages regarding the incident (Twitter, StatusPage, etc).\n\n\nNotify the IC of any customers reporting that they are affected by the incident.\n\n\nProvide customers with the external message from the post-mortem once it is completed.\n\n\n\n\nWho are they?\n#\n\n\nAny member of the Support Team can act as a customer liaison.\n\n\nHow can I become one?\n#\n\n\nFollow our \nCustomer Liaison training guide\n, and discuss with the Support Team about becoming our next Customer Liaison.\n\n\n\n\nInternal Liaison\n#\n\n\nWhat is it?\n#\n\n\nA person responsible for interacting with internal stakeholders. Whether it's notifying an internal team of the incident, or mobilizing additional responders within the organization.\n\n\nWhy have one?\n#\n\n\nFor larger incidents, we may have multiple teams across the organization involved. Having a dedicated liaison to mobilize those teams and bring them up to speed free's up the rest of the responders to handle the incident.\n\n\nWhat are the responsibilities?\n#\n\n\n\n\nPage SME's or other on-call engineers as instructed by the Incident Commander.\n\n\nNotify other teams within the organization (e.g. Finance, Legal, Marketing), as instructed by the Incident Commander.\n\n\nLiaise with stakeholders and provide status updates as necessary.\n\n\nInteract with internal stakeholders to answer their questions, to keep the primary call distraction free.\n\n\n\n\nWho are they?\n#\n\n\nAnyone designated by the Incident Commander during incident response.\n\n\nHow can I become one?\n#\n\n\nFollow our \nInternal Liaison training\n.",

Shut down servers, network isolate them, turn off a data center if you have to. Some common things to try,\n\n\n\n\nShutdown the instance from the provider console (do not delete or terminate if you can help it, as we'll need to do forensics).\n\n\nIf you happen to be logged into the box you can try to,\n\n\nRe-instate our default iptables rules to restrict traffic.\n\n\nkill -9\n any active session you think is an attacker.\n\n\nChange root password, and update /etc/shadow to lock out all other users.\n\n\nsudo shutdown now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCut Off Attack Vector\n#\n\n\nIdentify the likely attack vectors and path/fix them so they cannot be re-exploited immediately after stopping the attack.\n\n\n\n\nIf you suspect a third-party provider is compromised, delete all accounts except your own (and those of others who are physically present) and immediately rotate your password and MFA tokens.\n\n\nIf you suspect a service application was an attack vector, disable any relevant code paths, or shut down the service entirely.\n\n\n\n\nAssemble Response Team\n#\n\n\nIdentify the key responders for the security incident, and keep them all in the loop. Set up a secure method of communicating all information associated with the incident. Details on the incident (or even the fact that an incident has occurred) should be kept private to the responders until you are confident the attack is not being triggered internally.\n\n\n\n\nPage an Incident Commander if not already done so. They will also appoint the usual incident command roles. The incident command team will be responsible for keeping documentation of actions taken, and for notifying internal stakeholders as appropriate.\n\n\nGive the project an innocuous codename that can be used for chats/documents so if anyone overhears they don't realize it's a security incident. (e.g. sapphire-unicorn).\n\n\nStart the voice call if not already in progress.\n\n\nSetup chat room using the codename of the incident.\n\n\nInvite all responders to the voice call and chat room.\n\n\nThe \nsecurity team should always be included\n.\n\n\nA representative for any affected services should be included.\n\n\nExecutive stakeholders and legal counsel should be invited at earliest possible opportunity, but prioritize operational responders first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not communicate with anyone not on the response team about the incident until forensics has been performed. The attack could be happening internally.\n\n\nPrefix all emails, and chat topics with \"Attorney Work Project\".\n\n\n\n\nIsolate Affected Instances\n#\n\n\nAny instances which were affected by the attack should be immediately isolated from any other instances. As soon as possible, an image of the system should be taken and put into a read-only cold storage for later forensic analysis.\n\n\n\n\nBlacklist the IP addresses for any affected instances from all other hosts.\n\n\nTurn off and shutdown the instances immediately if you didn't do that to stop the attack.\n\n\nTake a disk image for any disks attached to the instances, and ship them to an off-site cold storage location. You should make sure these images are read-only and cannot be tampered with.\n\n\n\n\nIdentify Timeline of Attack\n#\n\n\nWork with all tools at your disposal to identify the timeline of the attack, along with exactly what the attacker did.\n\n\n\n\nAny reconnaissance the attacker performed on the system before the attack started.\n\n\nWhen the attacker gained access to the system.\n\n\nWhat actions the attacker performed on the system, and when.\n\n\nIdentify how long the attacker had access to the system before they were detected, and before they were kicked out.\n\n\nIdentify any queries the attacker ran on databases.\n\n\nTry to identify if the attacker still has access to the system via another back door. Monitor logs for unusual activity, etc.\n\n\n\n\nCompromised Data\n#\n\n\nUsing forensic analysis of log files, time-series graphs, and any other information/tools at your disposal, attempt to identify what information was compromised (if any),\n\n\n\n\nIdentify any data that was compromised during the attack.\n\n\nWas any data exfiltrated from a database?\n\n\nWhat keys were on the system that are now considering compromised?\n\n\nWas the attacker able to identify other components of the system (map out the network, etc).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind exactly what customer data has been compromised, if any.\n\n\n\n\nAssess Risk\n#\n\n\nBased on the data that was compromised, assess the risk to other systems.\n\n\n\n\nDoes the attacker have enough information to find another way in?\n\n\nWere any passwords or keys stored on the host? If so, they should be considered compromised, regardless of how they were stored.\n\n\nAny user accounts that were used in the initial attack should rotate all of their keys and passwords on every other system they have an account.\n\n\n\n\nApply Additional Mitigations\n#\n\n\nStart applying mitigations to other parts of your system.\n\n\n\n\nRotate any compromised data.\n\n\nIdentify any new alerting which is needed to notify of a similar breach.\n\n\nBlock any IP addresses associated with the attack.\n\n\nIdentify any keys/credentials that are compromised and revoke their access immediately.\n\n\n\n\nForensic Analysis\n#\n\n\nOnce you are confident the systems are secured, and enough monitoring is in place to detect another attack, you can move onto the forensic analysis stage.\n\n\n\n\nTake any read-only images you created, any access logs you have, and comb through them for more information about the attack.\n\n\nIdentify exactly what happened, how it happened, and how to prevent it in future.\n\n\nKeep track of all IP addresses involved in the attack.\n\n\nMonitor logs for any attempt to regain access to the system by the attacker.\n\n\n\n\nInternal Communication\n#\n\n\nDelegate to:\n VP or Director of Engineering\n\n\nCommunicate internally only once you are confident (via forensic analysis) that the attack was not sourced internally.\n\n\n\n\nDon't go into too much detail.\n\n\nOverview the timeline.\n\n\nDiscuss mitigation steps taken.\n\n\nFollow up with more information once it is known.\n\n\n\n\nLiaise With Law Enforcement / External Actors\n#\n\n\nDelegate to:\n VP or Director of Engineering\n\n\nWork with law enforcement to identify the source of the attack, letting any system owners know that systems under their control may be compromised, etc.\n\n\n\n\nContact local law enforcement.\n\n\nContact FBI.\n\n\nContact operators for any systems used in the attack, their systems may also have been compromised.\n\n\nContact security companies to help in assessing risk and any PR next steps.\n\n\nContact cyber insurance provider.\n\n\n\n\nExternal Communication\n#\n\n\nDelegate to:\n Marketing Team\n\n\nOnce you have validated all of the information you have is accurate, have a timeline of events, and know exactly what information was compromised, how it was compromised, and sure that it won't happen again. Only then should you prepare and release a public statement to customers informing them of the compromised information and any steps they need to take.\n\n\n\n\nInclude the date in the title of any announcement, so that it's never confused for a potential new breach.\n\n\nDon't say \"We take security very seriously\". It makes everyone cringe when they read it.\n\n\nBe honest, accept responsibility, and present the facts, along with exactly how we plan to prevent such things in future.\n\n\nBe as detailed as possible with the timeline.\n\n\nBe as detailed as possible in what information was compromised, and how it affects customers. If we were storing something we shouldn't have been, be honest about it. It'll come out later and it'll be much worse.\n\n\nDon't name and shame any external parties that might have caused the compromise. It's bad form. (Unless they've already publicly disclosed, in which case we can link to their disclosure).\n\n\nRelease the external communication as soon as possible, preferably within a few days of the compromise. The longer we wait, the worse it will be.\n\n\nIf possible, get in touch with customers' internal security teams before the general public notice is sent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunicating During an Incident\n#\n\n\n\n\nPrefer voice call and Slack over any other methods.\n\n\nAvoid email, but if you absolutely need to for some reason,\n\n\nSubject of emails should be \"Attorney Work Project\" and nothing else.\n\n\nIf email chain has \nANY\n contacts \nnot with the @pagerduty.com domain\n, make sure your emails are encrypted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not use SMS to communicate about the incident.\n\n\nThe only exception is to tell someone to move to a more secure channel. e.g. \"Please join Slack ASAP\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo not disseminate anything about the incident to those outside the response team until you have approval to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Reading\n#\n\n\n\n\nComputer Security Incident Handling Guide\n (NIST)\n\n\nIncident Handler's Handbook\n (SANS)\n\n\nResponding to IT Security Incidents\n (Microsoft)\n\n\nDefining Incident Management Processes for CSIRTs: A Work in Progress\n (CMU)\n\n\nCreating and Managing Computer Security Incident Handling Teams (CSIRTS)\n (CERT)",

A blame-free, detailed description, of exactly what went wrong in order to cause the incident, along with a list of steps to take in order to prevent a similar incident from occurring again in the future. The incident response process itself should also be included.\n\n\n\n\nDon't Neglect the Post-Mortem\n\n\nDon't make the mistake of neglecting a post-mortem after an incident. Without a post-mortem you fail to recognize what you're doing right, where you could improve, and most importantly, how to avoid making the same exact mistakes next time around. A well-designed, blameless post-mortem allows teams to continuously learn, and serves as a way to iteratively improve your infrastructure and incident response process.\n\n\n\n\nOwner Designation\n#\n\n\nThe first step is that a post-mortem owner will be designated. This is done by the IC either at the end of a major incident call, or very shortly after. You will be notified directly by the IC if you are the owner for the post-mortem. The owner is responsible for populating the post-mortem, looking up logs, managing the followup investigation, and keeping all interested parties in the loop.

Here's a description of the values and how we use them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatus\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraft\n\n\nIndicates that the content of the post-mortem is still being worked on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Review\n\n\nThe content of the post-mortem has been completed, and is ready to be reviewed during the post-mortem meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReviewed\n\n\nThe meeting is over and the content has been reviewed and agreed upon.\nIf there is an \"External Message\", the Customer Support team will take the message and update our status page as appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosed\n\n\nNo further actions are needed on the post-mortem (outstanding issues are tracked in JIRA).\nIf no \"External Message\", you can skip straight to this once the meeting is over.\nIf there's an \"External Message\", then the Support team will update it to this status once the message is posted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-Mortem\n#\n\n\nOnce you've been designated as the owner of a post-mortem, you should start creating one and updating it with all the relevant information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(If not already done by the IC) Create a new post-mortem for the incident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule a post-mortem meeting for within \n3 calendar days\n for a SEV-1 and \n5 business days\n for a SEV-2. You should schedule this before filling in the post-mortem, just so it's on the calendar.\n\n\n\n\nCreate the meeting on the \"Incident Post-Mortem Meetings\" shared calendar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBegin populating the page with all of the information you have.\n\n\n\n\nThe timeline should be the main focus to begin with.\n\n\nThe timeline should include important changes in status/impact, and also key actions taken by responders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo through the history in Slack to identify the responders, and add them to the page.\n\n\nIdentify the Incident Commander and Scribe in this list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulate the post-mortem with more detailed information.\n\n\n\n\nFor each item in the timeline, identify a metric, or some third-party page where the data came from. This could be a link to a Datadog graph, a SumoLogic search, a Tweet, etc. Anything which shows the data point you're trying to illustrate in the timeline.\n\n\nAdd a link to the incident call recording.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerform an analysis of the incident.\n\n\n\n\nCapture all available data regarding the incident. What caused it, how many customers were affected, etc.\n\n\nAny commands or queries you use to look up data should be posted in the page so others can see how the data was gathered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapture the impact to customers (generally in terms of event submission, delayed processing, and slow notification delivery)\n\n\nIdentify the underlying cause of the incident (What happened, and \nwhy\n did it happen).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite the external message that will be sent to customers. This will be reviewed during the post-mortem meeting before it is sent out.\n\n\n\n\nAvoid using the word \"outage\" unless it really was a full outage, use the word \"incident\" or \"service degradation\" instead. Customers generally see \"outage\" and assume the worst.\n\n\nLook at other examples of previous post-mortems to see the kind of thing you should send.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost a link to the post-mortem into Slack to be reviewed for style and content by internal parties, you should try to do this about \n24 hours before\n the meeting is scheduled.\n\n\n\n\nExperienced post-mortem writers will give you feedback on the level of detail and content of the post-mortem. This avoids wasted time during the meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttend the post-mortem meeting (see below section for more information).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate any followup action JIRA tickets (or note down topics for discussion if we need to decide on a direction to go before creating tickets),\n\n\n\n\nGo through the history in Slack to identify any TODO items.\n\n\nLabel all tickets with their severity level and date tags.\n\n\nAny actions which can reduce re-occurrence of the incident.\n\n\n(There may be some trade-off here, and that's fine. Sometimes the ROI isn't worth the effort that would go into it).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify any actions which can make our incident response process better.\n\n\nBe careful with creating too many tickets. Generally we only want to create things that are P0/P1's. Things that absolutely should be dealt with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunicate internally so we can learn from the incident.\n\n\n\n\nSend out an internal email to the relevant stakeholders describing the results and key learnings.\n\n\nInclude a link to the post-mortem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost-Mortem Meeting\n#\n\n\nThese meetings should generally last 15-30 minutes, and are intended to be a wrap up of the post-mortem process. We should discuss what happened, what we could've done better, and any followup actions we need to take. The goal is to suss out any disagreement on the facts, analysis, or recommended actions, and to get some wider awareness of the problems that are causing reliability issues for us.\n\n\nYou should invite the following people to the post-mortem meeting,\n\n\n\n\nAlways\n\n\nThe incident commander.\n\n\nThe incident commander shadowee (if there was one).\n\n\nService owners involved in the incident.\n\n\nKey engineer(s)/responders involved in the incident.\n\n\nEngineering manager for impacted systems.\n\n\nProduct manager for impacted systems. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptional\n\n\nCustomer liaison. (Only SEV-1 incidents)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe incident commander will run the meeting, keeping the discussion focused and on track. However the post-mortem owner will likely be doing most of the talking as they walk through the post-mortem report.\n\n\nA general agenda for the meeting would be something like,\n\n\n\n\nRecap the timeline, to make sure everyone agrees and is on the same page.\n\n\nRecap important points, and any unusual items.\n\n\nDiscuss how the problem could've been caught.\n\n\nDid it show up in \ncanary\n?\n\n\nCould it have been caught in tests, or loadtest environment?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscuss customer impact. Any comments from customers, etc.\n\n\nReview action items that have been created, discuss if appropriate, or if more are needed, etc.\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n#\n\n\nHere are some examples of post-mortems from other companies as a reference,\n\n\n\n\nStripe\n\n\nLastPass\n\n\nAWS\n\n\nTwilio\n\n\nHeroku\n\n\nNetflix\n\n\nGOV.UK Rail Accident Investigation\n\n\nA List of Post-mortems!\n\n\n\n\nUseful Resources\n#\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced PostMortem Fu and Human Error 101 (Velocity 2011)\n\n\nBlame.

What caused it, how many customers were affected, etc.  Any commands or queries you use to look up data should be posted in the page so others can see how the data was gathered.    Capture the impact to customers (generally in terms of event submission, delayed processing, and slow notification delivery)  Identify the underlying cause of the incident (What happened, and  why  did it happen).     Write the external message that will be sent to customers. This will be reviewed during the post-mortem meeting before it is sent out.   Avoid using the word \"outage\" unless it really was a full outage, use the word \"incident\" or \"service degradation\" instead. Customers generally see \"outage\" and assume the worst.  Look at other examples of previous post-mortems to see the kind of thing you should send.     Post a link to the post-mortem into Slack to be reviewed for style and content by internal parties, you should try to do this about  24 hours before  the meeting is scheduled.   Experienced post-mortem writers will give you feedback on the level of detail and content of the post-mortem. This avoids wasted time during the meeting.     Attend the post-mortem meeting (see below section for more information).    Create any followup action JIRA tickets (or note down topics for discussion if we need to decide on a direction to go before creating tickets),   Go through the history in Slack to identify any TODO items.  Label all tickets with their severity level and date tags.  Any actions which can reduce re-occurrence of the incident.  (There may be some trade-off here, and that's fine. Sometimes the ROI isn't worth the effort that would go into it).    Identify any actions which can make our incident response process better.  Be careful with creating too many tickets. Generally we only want to create things that are P0/P1's. Things that absolutely should be dealt with.     Communicate internally so we can learn from the incident.   Send out an internal email to the relevant stakeholders describing the results and key learnings.  Include a link to the post-mortem.",

Discuss how the problem could've been caught.  Did it show up in  canary ?  Could it have been caught in tests, or loadtest environment?    Discuss customer impact.

This section goes over our training material for the various roles that are involved in our incident response, along with some additional information and training material from government agencies.\n\n\nTraining Guides\n#\n\n\nOur training guides are split up by role, however you are encouraged to read through the training guides even for roles you don't belong to, as it can give you some good insight into how those people will be behaving during major incidents.\n\n\n\n\nIncident Commander Training\n - The \"IC\" is the person who drives a major incident to resolution. They're the person who will be directing everyone else.\n\n\nDeputy Training\n - The Deputy is someone who supports the Incident Commander and can take over for them if necessary.\n\n\nScribe Training\n - This is intended for individuals who will be acting as a scribe during an incident.\n\n\nSME / Resolver Training\n - This is relevant to everyone at PagerDuty who are on-call for any team.\n\n\nCustomer Liaison Training\n - This is for individuals who will be publicly representing us and interacting with customers.\n\n\nInternal Liaison Training\n - This is relevant for anyone who might be called upon to work with teams internal during an incident.\n\n\n\n\nTraining Courses\n#\n\n\nWe've also published slides and videos of some of our training courses. Originally used internally at PagerDuty to train our staff, we've since adapted them for a wider audience so you can make use of them in your own organizations.\n\n\n\n\nIncident Response Training Course\n - Introductory course on incident response and the role of the Incident Commander.\n\n\n\n\nExample Incident\n#\n\n\nThis recorded call is a reenactment of an actual major incident that occurred at PagerDuty in \nJanuary 2017\n. Some details have been changed in the interest of brevity and privacy, but the incident remains otherwise largely intact. For more details about the recording, you can read the \nPagerDuty blog post\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Incident Management System (NIMS)\n#\n\n\nOur incident response process is loosely based on the \nUS National Incident Management System (NIMS)\n, which is described as,\n\n\nA systematic, proactive approach to guide departments and agencies at all levels of government, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector to work together seamlessly and manage incidents involving all threats and hazards\u2014regardless of cause, size, location, or complexity\u2014in order to reduce loss of life, property and harm to the environment.\n\n\nWhile it might not initially seem that this would be applicable to an IT operations environment, we've found that many of the lessons learned from major incidents in these situations can be directly applied to our industry too. The principles are the same and span many different environments.\n\n\n \n\n\nIf you want to learn more about NIMS, we recommend the \nICS-100\n and \nICS-700\n online training courses, which go over NIMS and the Incident Command System (You can also take an online examination after training in order to get a certificate from FEMA). There is also a wealth of \nadditional training material and courses from FEMA\n on NIMS, which I would encourage you to look at.\n\n\nIf you're based in the US and interested in taking a more active incident response role in your community, we recommend investigating your local \nCERT programs\n (Community Emergency Response Teams). Many cities offer CERT training, after which you can volunteer as a CERT contributor within your community.

While it might not initially seem that this would be applicable to an IT operations environment, we've found that many of the lessons learned from major incidents in these situations can be directly applied to our industry too. The principles are the same and span many different environments.     If you want to learn more about NIMS, we recommend the  ICS-100  and  ICS-700  online training courses, which go over NIMS and the Incident Command System (You can also take an online examination after training in order to get a certificate from FEMA). There is also a wealth of  additional training material and courses from FEMA  on NIMS, which I would encourage you to look at.  If you're based in the US and interested in taking a more active incident response role in your community, we recommend investigating your local  CERT programs  (Community Emergency Response Teams). Many cities offer CERT training, after which you can volunteer as a CERT contributor within your community.

You don't need to be a senior team member to become an IC, anyone can do it providing you have the requisite knowledge (yes, even an intern)!\n\n\nPurpose\n#\n\n\nIf you could boil down the purpose of an Incident Commander to one sentence, it would be,\n\n\n\n\nKeep the incident moving towards resolution.\n\n\n\n\nThe Incident Commander is the decision maker during an major incident; Delegating tasks and listening to input from subject matter experts in order to bring the incident to resolution. They become the highest ranking individual on any major incident call, regardless of their day-to-day rank. Their decisions made as commander are final.\n\n\nYour job as an Incident Commander is to listen to the call and to watch the incident Slack room in order to provide clear coordination, recruiting others to gather context/details. \nYou should not be performing any actions or remediations, checking graphs, or investigating logs.\n Those tasks should be delegated.\n\n\nAn IC should also be considering next steps and backup plans at every opportunity, in an effort avoid getting stuck without any clear options to proceed, and to keep things moving towards resolution.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n#\n\n\nBefore you can be an Incident Commander, it is expected that you meet the following criteria. Don't worry if you don't meet them all yet, you can still continue with training!\n\n\n\n\nExcellent verbal and written \ncommunication skills\n.\n\n\nHas \nhigh-level knowledge\n of how the different PagerDuty services interact with each other.\n\n\nAbility to size-up a situation, \nassess the effectiveness\n of various tactics/strategies, and \nmake rapid decisions\n on appropriate courses of action.\n\n\nHas flexibility, and is able to \nlisten to expert feedback\n, modifying plans on-the-fly as necessary.\n\n\nHas been \ninvolved in at least two major incident responses\n, either as a spectator, or as an active participant.\n\n\nHas gravitas, \ntakes command\n, and is \nwilling to kick people off a call\n to remove distractions, even if it's the CEO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep technical knowledge not required!\n\n\nIncident Commanders do not require deep technical knowledge of our systems\n. Your job as Incident Commander is to coordinate the response, not make technical changes. Don\u2019t think you can\u2019t be an Incident Commander just because you\u2019re not in the engineering department!\n\n\n\n\nResponsibilities\n#\n\n\nRead up on our \nDifferent Roles for Incidents\n to see what is expected from an Incident Commander, as well as what we expect from the other roles you'll be interacting with.\n\n\nTraining Process\n#\n\n\nThe process is fairly loose for now. Here's a list of things you can do to train though,\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the rest of this page, particularly the sections below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipate in \nFailure Friday\n (FF).\n\n\n\n\nShadow a FF to see how it's run.\n\n\nBe the scribe for multiple FF's.\n\n\nBe the incident commander for multiple FF's.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay a game of \"\nKeep Talking and Nobody Explodes\n\" with other people in the office.\n\n\n\n\nFor a more realistic experience, play it with someone in a different office over Hangouts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShadow a current incident commander for at least a full week shift.\n\n\n\n\nGet alerted when they do, join in on the same calls.\n\n\nSit in on an active incident call, follow along with the chat, and follow along with what the Incident Commander is doing.\n\n\nDo not actively participate in the call, keep your questions until the end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReverse shadow a current incident commander for at least a full week shift.\n\n\n\n\nYou should be the one to respond to incidents, and you will take point on calls, however the current IC will be there to take over should you not know how to proceed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduation\n#\n\n\nWhat's the difference between an IC in training, and an IC? (This isn't the set up to a joke). Simple, an IC puts themselves on the schedules.\n\n\nAlso, don't forget to announce yourself in the IC Slack channel, and get yourself added to our IC mailing list.\n\n\nHandling Incidents\n#\n\n\nEvery incident is different (we're hopefully not repeating the same issue multiple times!), but there's a common process you can apply to each one. The language used in each step is discussed in more detail in the \"Procedures and Lingo\" section below.\n\n\n\n\nSize-Up\n#\n\n\nSizing-up involves getting an idea of what's going on, and how much impact it's having. This is an information gathering step that will allow you to make good decisions later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the symptoms. \n- Ask \"What's wrong?\"\n\n\n\n\nIdentify what the symptoms are, ask your experts to provide this information.\n\n\nGather as much information as you can, as quickly as you can (remember the incident is still happening while you're doing this).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify scope of incident. \n- Ask \"Is this affecting multiple services?\"\n\n\n\n\nIdentify how big the issue is, and whether it's escalating/flapping/static.\n\n\nGet the facts, the possibilities of what can happen, and the probability of those things happening.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStabilize\n#\n\n\nNext step is to stabilize the incident. We need to determine what we can do to fix it, and then execute those actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentify possible actions. \n- Ask \"What actions can we take? How risky are they?\"\n\n\n\n\nIdentify any actions you can take to alleviate the issue. Ask your experts what they want to do.\n\n\nIdentify the risks associated with each of those actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake a decision. \n- Say \"We're proceeding with...\"\n\n\n\n\nDecide which action to take based on the information you have available.\n\n\nMaking the \"wrong\" decision is better than making no decision. If you have nothing but bad options, pick one and proceed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGain consensus. \n- Ask \"Are there any strong objections?\"\n\n\n\n\nGather support for the plan (See \"Polling During a Decision\" below).\n\n\nListen for objections.\n\n\nBe prepared to adjust your plan if new information is presented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssign task. \n- Say \"A, please perform B, I'll come back to you in X minutes. Understood?\"\n\n\n\n\nDelegate remediation actions to your SME's.\n\n\nTasks should be assigned to an individual and be time-boxed.\n\n\nGet acknowledgement that the task was understood and is being executed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate\n#\n\n\nWhile remediation steps are being carried out, it's important to provide status updates, not just to responders, but other stakeholders within the organization.\n\n\n\n\nProvide regular updates. \n- Say \"Here's a status update: ...\"\n\n\nMaintain a cadence, and provide regular updates to everyone on the call.\n\n\nWhat's happening, what are we doing about it, etc.\n\n\nKeep updates short and factual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerify\n#\n\n\nOnce remediation actions have been performed, we need to verify that they have been successful or not, and proceed with a backup plan if not.\n\n\n\n\nFollow-up on task completion. \n- Ask \"Have you finished?\"\n\n\nAsk for the status of task completion from the tasks you assigned out.\n\n\nIf responders need more time, give them more time.\n\n\nIf problems persist, begin again from the size-up step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeputy\n#\n\n\nThe deputy for an incident is generally the backup Incident Commander. However, as an Incident Commander, you may appoint one or more Deputies. Note that Deputy Incident Commanders must be as qualified as the Incident Commander, and that if a Deputy is assigned, he or she must be fully qualified to assume the Incident Commander\u2019s position if required.\n\n\nCommunication Responsibilities\n#\n\n\nSharing information during an incident is a critical process. As an Incident Commander (or Deputy), you should be prepared to brief others as necessary. You will also be required to communicate your intentions and decisions clearly so that there is no ambiguity in your commands.\n\n\nWhen given information from a responder, you should clearly acknowledge that you have received and understood their message, so that the responder can be confident in moving on to other tasks.\n\n\nAfter an incident, you should communicate with other training Incident Commanders on any debrief actions you feel are necessary.\n\n\n\n\nClear is better than concise.\n\n\nRemember that clear communication is better than concise communication. It can be tempting to try and abbreviate or rush speech in order to speed up the response. This can lead to confusion and misunderstandings which will ultimate increase the response time. Always favour clear communication, even if takes a little bit longer.\n\n\n\n\nIncident Call Procedures and Lingo\n#\n\n\nThe \nSteps for Incident Commander\n provide a detailed description of what you should be doing during an incident.\n\n\nAdditionally, aside from following the \nusual incident call etiquette\n, there a few extra etiquette guidelines you should follow as IC:\n\n\n\n\nAlways announce when you join the call if you are the on-call IC.\n\n\nDon't let discussions get out of hand. Keep conversations short.\n\n\nNote objections from others, but your call is final.\n\n\nIf anyone is being actively disruptive to your call, kick them off.\n\n\nAnnounce the end of the call.\n\n\n\n\nHere are some examples of phrases and patterns you should use during incident calls.\n\n\nStart of Call Announcement\n#\n\n\nAt the start of any major incident call, the incident commander should announce the following,\n\n\n\n\nThis is [NAME], I am the Incident Commander for this call.\n\n\n\n\nThis establishes to everyone on the call what your name is, and that you are now the commander. Identify yourself by name and state that you are the \"Incident Commander\" and not \"IC\", as newcomers may not be familiar with the terminology yet. The word \"commander\" makes it very clear that you're in charge.\n\n\nStart of Incident, IC Not Present\n#\n\n\nIf you are trained to be an IC and have joined a call, even if you aren't the IC on-call, you should do the following,\n\n\n\n\nIs there an IC on the call?\n\n\n(pause)\n\n\nHearing no response, this is [NAME], and I am now the Incident Commander for this call.\n\n\n\n\nIf the on-call IC joins later, you may hand over to them at your discretion (see below for the hand-off procedure)\n\n\nChecking if SME's are Present\n#\n\n\nDuring a call, you will want to know who is available from the various teams in order to resolve the incident. Etiquette dictates that people should announce themselves, but sometimes you may be joining late to the call. If you need a representative from a team, just ask on the call. Your deputy can page one if no one answers.\n\n\n\n\nDo we have a representative from [X] on the call?\n\n\n(pause)\n\n\nDeputy, can you go ahead and page the [X] on-call please.\n\n\n\n\nAssigning Tasks\n#\n\n\nWhen you need to give out an assignment or task, you should follow these three steps,\n\n\n\n\nAssign the task to a specific person directly.\n\n\nTime-box the task with a specific number of minutes.\n\n\nConfirm that the responder has acknowledged and understood the instructions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan someone...\n\n\nNever say \"Can someone...\" as this leads to the \nbystander effect\n. Tasks should always be assigned directly to an individual, and never just thrown out with the hope that someone will pick it up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIC: Bob, please investigate the high latency on web app boxes. I'll come back to you for an answer in 3 minutes.\n\n\nBob: Understood\n\n\n\n\nKeep track of how many minutes you assigned, and check in with that person after that time. You can get help from your deputy to help track the timings.\n\n\nGaining Consensus (Polling During a Decision)\n#\n\n\nIf a decision needs to be made, it comes down to the IC. Once the IC makes a decision, it is final. But it's important that no one can come later and object to the plan, saying things like \"I knew that would happen\". An IC will use very specific language to be sure that doesn't happen, and to gain implicit consensus of everyone on the response.\n\n\n\n\nThe proposal is to [EXPLAIN PROPOSAL]\n\n\nAre there any strong objections to this plan?\n\n\n(pause)\n\n\nHearing no objects, we are proceeding with this proposal.\n\n\n\n\nIf you were to ask \"Does everyone agree?\", you'd get people speaking over each other, you'd have quiet people not speaking up, etc. Asking for any STRONG objections gives people the chance to object, but only if they feel strongly on the matter. It also means that the information you care about the most (objections to proceeding) are heard loud and clearly.\n\n\nStatus Updates\n#\n\n\nIt's important to maintain a cadence during a major incident call. Whenever there is a lull in the proceedings, usually because you're waiting for someone to get back to you, you can fill the gap by explaining the current situation and the actions that are outstanding. This makes sure everyone is on the same page.\n\n\n\n\nWhile we wait for [X], here's an update of our current situation.\n\n\nWe are currently in a SEV-1 situation, we believe to be caused by [X]. There's an open question to [Y] who will be getting back to us in 2 minutes. In the meantime, we have Tweeted out that we are experiencing issues. Our next Tweet will be in 10 minutes if the incident is still ongoing at that time.\n\n\nAre there any additional actions or proposals from anyone else at this time?\n\n\n\n\nReducing Scope\n#\n\n\nOnce you've identified the cause of an incident, you can take some time to reduce the scope of your call. For example, if you've identified that a bad deploy is the cause, there's no need to keep your network engineering responder on the call. Responders will usually appreciate not having to stick around for something that doesn't involve them, especially when it's 3am. Generally, it's best to list out the people you want to remain on the call (rather than listing those that can leave), as this not only re-affirms who is required, but makes sure you won't forget about anyone who can leave.\n\n\n\n\nNow that we've identified the primary cause and are on the way to recovery, I need the deputy, scribe, support, and site-reliability experts to stay on the call. Everyone else, thanks very much for your response, feel free to drop-off at your discretion.\n\n\n\n\nThere's no need to forcibly remove anyone from the call, leave the choice open. Sometimes responders prefer to remain to see how the incident eventually resolves, since they're already awake anyway.\n\n\nSpinning Off Sub-Teams\n#\n\n\nWhen handling \ncomplex incidents\n, it will sometimes be necessary to spin off a sub-team (or multiple sub-teams) to investigate specific issues in more detail before reporting back. This is to ensure that you can maintain an effective span of control. To do this, you should assign a team leader, give them a specific task (time-boxed in the usual way), and re-affirm that they are your primary contact and that all communication from their team should come via the leader. Use our pre-defined team names of Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie to avoid confusion when creating the teams.\n\n\n\n\nIC: Anne, I'd like you to lead a sub-team to investigate the ongoing latency in the web-tier. Please gather your desired team and investigate, get back to me in 20 minutes. All communication from your team should be filtered through you. Use the Alpha team rooms and phone bridge.\n\n\nAnne: Understood, I'll get back with an update in 20 minutes.\n\n\n\n\nYou do not need to prescribe who their team consists of. Either they will have a pre-existing team structure they can utilize, or they should take the initiative to assemble a team on their own. You should pick your team leaders accordingly.\n\n\nTransfer of Command\n#\n\n\nTransfer of command, involves (as the name suggests) transferring command to another Incident Commander. There are multiple reasons why a transfer of command might take place,\n\n\n\n\nCommander has become fatigued and is unable to continue.\n\n\nIncident complexity changes.\n\n\nChange of command is necessary for effectiveness or efficiency.\n\n\nPersonal emergencies arise (e.g., Incident Commander has a family emergency).\n\n\n\n\nNever feel like you are not doing your job properly by handing over. Handovers are encouraged. In order to handover, out of band from the main call (via Slack for example), notify the other IC that you wish to transfer command. Update them with anything you feel appropriate. Then announce on the call,\n\n\n\n\nEveryone on the call, be advised, at this time I am handing over command to [X].\n\n\n\n\nThe new IC should then announce on the call as if they were joining a new call (see above), so that everyone is aware of the new commander.\n\n\nNote that the arrival of a more qualified person does NOT necessarily mean a change in incident command.\n\n\nEnd of Call Sign-Off\n#\n\n\nAt the end of an incident, you should announce to everyone on the call that you are ending the call at this time, and provide information on where followup discussion can take place. It's also customary to thank everyone.\n\n\n\n\nOk everyone, we're ending the call at this time. Please continue any followup discussion on Slack. Thanks everyone.\n\n\n\n\nHandling Problems\n#\n\n\nThings don't always go smoothly on incident response calls, so as an Incident Commander you need to be prepared for instances where the conversation gets derailed, either intentionally or unintentionally. Here are some procedures and lingo you can follow when things get disruptive, in order to get things back on track.\n\n\nMaintaining Order\n#\n\n\nOften times on a call people will be talking over one another, or an argument on the correct way to proceed may break out. As Incident Commander it's important that order is maintained on a call. The Incident Commander has the power to remove someone from the call if necessary (even if it's the CEO). But often times you just need to remind people to speak one at a time. Sometimes the discussion can be healthy even if it starts as an argument, but you shouldn't let it go on for too long.\n\n\n\n\n(noise)\n\n\nOk everyone, can we all speak one at a time please. So far I'm hearing two options to proceed: 1) [X], 2) [Y].\n\n\nAre there any other proposals someone would like to make at this time?\n\n\n...etc\n\n\n\n\nGetting Straight Answers\n#\n\n\nYou may ask a question as IC and receive an answer that doesn't actually answer your question. This is generally when you ask for a yes/no answer but get a more detailed explanation. This can often times be because the person doesn't understand the call etiquette. But if it continues, you need to take action in order to proceed.\n\n\n\n\nIC: Is this going to disable the service for everyone?\n\n\nSME: Well... for some people it....\n\n\nIC: Stop. I need a yes/no answer. Is this going to disable the service for everyone?\n\n\nSME: Well... it might not do...\n\n\nIC: Stop. I'm going to ask again, and the only two words I want to hear from you are \"yes\" or \"no. Is this going to disable the service for everyone?\n\n\nSME: Well.. like I was saying..\n\n\nIC: Stop. Leave the call. Backup IC can you please page the backup on-call for [service] so that we can get an answer.\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Swoop - Overriding the Incident Commander\n#\n\n\n\n\nExecutive: Ignore the incident commander, do what I say!\n\n\n\n\nThis is an extreme example, but illustrates the concept of \"Executive Swoop\", whereby someone who would be senior to you during peacetime comes on the call and starts overriding your decisions as IC. This is unacceptable behaviour during wartime, as the IC is in command. This is rare, but can cripple the response process if it happens. There is a simple question you can ask as an Incident Commander to get things back on track, \"Do you wish to take command?\",\n\n\n\n\nExecutive: No, I don't want us doing that. Everyone stop. We need to rollback instead.\n\n\nIC: Hold please. [EXECUTIVE], do you wish to take over command?\n\n\nExecutive: Yes/No\n\n\n(If yes) IC: Understood. Everyone on the call, be advised, at this time I am handling over command to [EXECUTIVE]. They are now the incident commander for this call.\n\n\n(If no) IC: In that case, please cause no further interruptions or I will remove you from the call.\n\n\n\n\nThis makes it clear to the executive that they have the option of being in charge and making decisions, but in order to do so they must continue as an Incident Commander. If they refuse, then remind them that you are in charge and disruptive interruptions will not be tolerated. If they continue, remove them from the call.\n\n\nExecutive Swoop - Anti-Motivation\n#\n\n\n\n\nExecutive: Let's try and resolve this in 10 minutes please!\n\n\n\n\nIt's rare for an executive to maliciously derail an incident response call, usually it is done with the best of intentions. However, these good intentions can still derail your response process and demotivate responders. As an Incident Commander you will need to recognize and respond to these situations. In the case above, it seems motivational, however it assumes responders aren't already working as hard as possible to solve the problem, and adds no value to the response process. You can respond to this by reminding the commenter that these things should be kept until after the incident is over.\n\n\n\n\nIC: We're in the middle of an incident, please keep your comments until the end.\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Swoop - Wants Information\n#\n\n\n\n\nExecutive: Can I get a spreadsheet of all affected customers?\n\n\n\n\nThe most common case of executive swoop is a request for more information. Unfortunately, when in the middle of an incident, you typically cannot spare the resources to gather such information. As an incident commander you should remind the executive of this, and that the incident takes priority.\n\n\n\n\nWe can either get you that list, or fix the incident. Not both. The incident takes priority.\n\n\n\n\nNote that this isn't phrased as a question, you've already made the decision as Incident Commander, you're just informing the executive of that decision.\n\n\nExecutive Swoop - Questioning Severity\n#\n\n\n\n\nExecutive: Is this really a SEV-1?\n\n\n\n\nOur severity levels determine the scale of response we give to an incident. Conversations on what severity an incident is can very quickly consume the entire call and doesn't change the fact that there is an incident on-going. We do not discuss incident severity during an incident call, as we treat an incident as the highest severity we think it could be. We can downgrade the severity during the post-mortem, however we cannot waste time litigating severities on an incident call. So simply remind folks of this in order to get things back on track,\n\n\n\n\nIC: We do not discuss incident severity during the call. We're treating this as a SEV-1.\n\n\n\n\nThe Belligerent Responder\n#\n\n\nSometimes you will have a responder who does not follow instructions and/or is being actively disruptive to your response call. Perhaps this is being done intentionally, or it could even be unintentional (an un-muted microphone while in a loud environment, etc). In either case, you need to resolve the situation and get back to the incident at hand. State the fact that the individual is being disruptive, provide them a way to save face, but also state what will happen if they don't stop. No second chances, if they don't follow through, remove them from the call.\n\n\n\n\nYou're being disruptive. Please stop, or I will have to remove you from the call.\n\n\n\n\nExamples From Pop Culture\n#\n\n\nPagerDuty employees have access to all previous incident calls, and can listen to them at their discretion. We can't release these calls, so for everyone else, here are some short examples from popular culture to show the techniques at work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's a clip from the movie Apollo 13, where Gene Kranz (Flight Director / Incident Commander) shows some great examples of Incident Command. Here are some things to note:\n\n\n\n\nWalks into the room, and immediately obvious that he's the IC. Calms the noise, and makes sure everyone is paying attention.\n\n\nProvides a status update so people are aware of the situation.\n\n\nProjector breaks, doesn't get sidetracked on fixing it, just moves on to something else.\n\n\nProvides a proposal for how to proceed and elicits feedback.\n\n\nListens to the feedback calmly.\n\n\nWhen counter-proposal is raised, states that he agrees and why.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAllows a discussion to happen, listens to all points. When discussion gets out of hand, re-asserts command of the situation.\n\n\nExplains his decision, and why.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplains his full plan and decision, so everyone is on the same page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother clip from Apollo 13. Things to note:\n\n\n\n\nSummarizes the situation, and states the facts.\n\n\nListens to the feedback from various people.\n\n\nWhen a trusted SME provides information counter to what everyone else is saying, asks for additional clarification (\"What do you mean, everything?\")\n\n\nWise cracking remarks are not acknowledged by the IC (\"You can't run a vacuum cleaner on 12 amps!\")\n\n\n\"That's the deal?\".. \"That's the deal\".\n\n\nOnce decision is made, moves on to the next discussion.\n\n\nDelegates tasks.",

There is a simple question you can ask as an Incident Commander to get things back on track, \"Do you wish to take command?\",   Executive: No, I don't want us doing that. Everyone stop.

Allows a discussion to happen, listens to all points. When discussion gets out of hand, re-asserts command of the situation.  Explains his decision, and why.    Explains his full plan and decision, so everyone is on the same page.     Another clip from Apollo 13. Things to note:   Summarizes the situation, and states the facts.

This page details everything you need to know in order to be prepared for that responsibility. If you are interested in becoming an Incident Commander, take a look at the \nIncident Commander Training page\n.\n\n\nOn-Call Expectations\n#\n\n\nIf you are on-call for your team, there are certain expectations of you as that on-call. This applies to both the primary and secondary on-calls. Getting paged about a SEV-3 or SEV-4 in your system comes with different expectations than getting paged with a major SEV-2.\n\n\nBefore Going On-Call\n#\n\n\n\n\nBe prepared, by having already familiarized yourself with our incident response policies and procedures. In particular,\n\n\nDifferent Roles for Incidents\n - You will be acting as a \"Resolver\" or \"SME\". But you should familiarize yourself with the other roles and what they will be doing.\n\n\nIncident Call Etiquette\n - How to behave during an incident call.\n\n\nDuring an Incident\n - What to do during an incident. You are specifically interested in the \"Resolver\" steps, but you should familiarize yourself with the entire document.\n\n\nGlossary\n - Familiarize yourself with the terminology that may be used during the call.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you have set up your alerting methods, and that PagerDuty can \nbypass your \"Do Not Disturb\" settings\n.\n\n\nCheck you can join the incident call. You may need to install a browser plugin. You don't want to be doing that the first time you get paged.\n\n\nBe aware of your upcoming on-call time and arrange swaps around travel, vacations, appointments, etc.\n\n\nIf you are an Incident Commander, make sure you are not on-call for your team at the same time as being on-call as Incident Commander.\n\n\n\n\nDuring On-Call Period\n#\n\n\n\n\nHave your laptop and Internet with you at all times during your on-call period (office, home, a MiFi, a phone with a tethering plan, etc).\n\n\nIf you have important appointments, you need to get someone else on your team to cover that time slot in advance.\n\n\nWhen you receive an alert for a major incident, you are expected to join the incident call and Slack as quickly as possible (within minutes).\n\n\nYou will be asked questions or given actions by the Incident Commander. Answer questions concisely, and follow all actions given (even if you disagree with them).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponse Mobilization\n#\n\n\nWhen an incident occurs, you must be mobilized or assigned to become part of the incident response. In other words, until you are mobilized to the incident via a page or being directly asked by someone else on the incident, you remain in your everyday role. After being mobilized, your first task is to check in and receive an assignment. While it's tempting to see an incident happening and want to jump in and help, when resources show up that have not been requested, the management of the incident can be compromised.\n\n\n\"Never Hesitate to Escalate\"\n#\n\n\nIf you're not sure about something, it is perfectly acceptable to bring in other SMEs from your team that you believe know a given system better than you. Don't let your ego keep you from bringing in additional help. Our motto is \"Never hesitate to escalate\", you will never be looked down upon for escalating something because you didn't know how to handle it.\n\n\nBlameless\n#\n\n\nThere will be incidents. Some will be caused by you, some will be caused by others... some will just happen. Our entire incident response process is completely blameless. Blaming people is counter productive and just distracts from the problem at hand. No matter how an incident started, they all need to get solved as quickly as possible.\n\n\nWartime vs Peacetime\n#\n\n\nBehavior during a major incident is very different to any other alert you may have received in the past. We call a major incident \"wartime\", and make a distinction between that and normal everyday operations (\"peacetime\").\n\n\nPeacetime\n#\n\n\nThe organizational structure is generally based on seniority. The more senior members of a team will lead discussions, and managers or team leads will have the final say. Decisions are made after careful consideration of all options, and to minimize potential risk to customers.\n\n\nWartime\n#\n\n\nWartime is different, and you will notice on our major incident calls that there's a different organizational structure.\n\n\n\n\nThe Incident Commander is in charge. No matter their rank during peacetime, they are now the highest ranked individual on the call, higher than the CEO.\n\n\nPrimary responders (folks acting as primary on-call for a team/service) are the highest ranked individuals for that service.\n\n\nDecisions will be made by the IC after consideration of the information presented. Once that decision is made, it is final.\n\n\nRiskier decisions can be made by the IC than would normally be considered during peacetime.\n\n\nFor example, the IC may decide to drop events for a particular customer in order to maintain the integrity of the system for everyone else.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IC may go against a consensus decision. If a poll is done, and 9/10 people agree but 1 disagrees. The IC may choose the disagreement option despite a majority vote.\n\n\nEven if you disagree, the IC's decision is final. During the call is not the time to argue with them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IC may use language or behave in a way you find rude. This is wartime, and they need to do whatever it takes to resolve the situation, so sometimes rudeness occurs. This is never anything personal, and something you should be prepared to experience if you've never been in a wartime situation before.\n\n\nYou may be asked to leave the call by the IC, or you may even be forceable kicked off a call. It is at the IC's discretion to do this if they feel you are not providing useful input. Again, this is nothing personal and you should remember that wartime is different than peacetime.",

            "text": "Incident Response Training Course\n\n\nThis is an open-source version of \"Incident Response Training\", our PagerDuty training course for incident response and incident command. It started as an internal course to train new Incident Commanders and has since developed into one that we now deliver publicly.\n\n\nIt includes lots of introductory information on our process, and details on the Incident Commander role specifically. All the information is already available as part of our \npublic documentation\n , this is just a different way of presenting it that's hopefully more engaging. Feel free to use this as a base for training in your own organization.\n\n\nThe text presented here is a semi-accurate transcription of how the training is usually delivered. You can also watch a \nvideo\n of an older version of this course if you prefer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n#\n\n\n\n\n001. \"Incident Response Training\".\n\n\nHi, I'm Rich, and welcome to \"Incident Response Training\". This is a shorter version of our internal training at PagerDuty, which we use to train up our new Incident Commanders. It's been slightly adapted for a wider audience, but the majority is exactly what we run ourselves. We're not going to be able to cover everything, otherwise we'd be here for a few days, but I'll cover some of the most important parts of our process. I'll try to keep this as short as I can.\n\n\nActually, how long do we have? Can someone keep track of time for me? That would be great, thanks!\n\n\n\n\nLearn How to Effectively Manage Incidents\n#\n\n\n\n\n002. Learn how to effectively manage incidents.\n\n\nThe goal of this session is to give you an understanding of how to effectively manage incidents within your organization. I'll describe the process we use at PagerDuty for managing critical incidents, and talk in more detail about a specific role called the \"Incident Commander\".\n\n\nThis isn't a sales pitch. I'm not on our sales team, and this isn't a talk about how to use PagerDuty to manage your incidents (although obviously it would be awesome if you did). The intent today is to introduce you to how we manage incidents internally at PagerDuty, and provide you with lots of practical information you can take away to your own organizations to either start or improve your own incident response processes.\n\n\n\n\nReplace Chaos with Calm\n#\n\n\n\n\n003. Replace chaos with calm.\n\n\nLet's start with a quick question. How does incident response usually go in your organization today? Is it a smooth and streamlined process, or is it a lot of people talking over one another? For most of you it's probably going to be somewhere in the middle.\n\n\nWe want less of the latter, and more of the former. We want to replace chaos with calm. Panic and chaos are not good during an incident, they only exacerbate things and causes more confusion. We want things to be calm and organized.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Incident Response?\n#\n\n\n\n\n004. What is incident response? \nDocs Reference\n\n\nSo when we talk about incident response, what we're really talking about is an organized approach to addressing and managing an incident. This is how we define incident response at PagerDuty. They key here is on the word \norganized\n. We don't want to be running around in a panic anytime an alert goes off. We want our response to be almost routine, and for everyone to work together like a well-oiled machine.\n\n\nThere's a quote I really like from an excellent book called \nIncident Management for Operations\n that's appropriate here,\n\n\n\n\nFire is not an emergency to the fire department . . . [Y]ou expect a rapid response from a group of professionals, skilled in the art of solving whatever issues you are having.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal of Incident Response\n#\n\n\n\n\n005. Goal of incident response. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nIt may surprise you to learn the goal of incident response isn\u2019t just about solving the problem. Give a thousand monkeys a keyboard and enough time and they can probably solve your problem. That's not good incident response. We want to solve the problem in a way which limits the damage caused, and reduces the recovery time and costs. I don\u2019t just mean \nfinancial\n cost either, there\u2019s a cost associated with engineer health too. Constantly waking people up at 3am can have a dramatic negative effect on their health and happiness.\n\n\nIf financial impact is all you care about though, let's not forget that \npeople are expensive\n. In a large organization, a phone bridge with 100 people sitting there mostly idle for several hours is not unheard of. If each of those people cost ~$100/hour, that\u2019s $10K every hour! That\u2019s \nreally\n expensive to the business.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is an Incident?\n#\n\n\n\n\n006. What is an incident? \nDocs Reference\n\n\nBefore we can respond to an incident though, we need to \ndefine what an incident actually is\n. It sounds silly, but if you\u2019re not sure whether something\u2019s an incident, you don\u2019t know whether to respond to it.\n\n\nHere is PagerDuty\u2019s definition of an incident,\n\n\n\n\nAn unplanned disruption or degradation of service that is actively affecting customers' ability to use the product.\n\n\n\n\n\"Customers\" here doesn't just refer to external customers, but can refer to internal customers too.\n\n\nYour definition might be different, and that\u2019s OK. I just wanted to give you an idea of the kind of definition that can get you started. You want your definition to be simple, no more than a sentence, and easily understood by anyone.\n\n\nYou may notice that this is quite a broad definition though. A typo technically fits this description. As does a full outage. Obviously these are very different scenarios. So we do have something else too.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a Major Incident?\n#\n\n\n\n\n007. What is a major incident? \nDocs Reference\n\n\nWe also have something we call a \nmajor incident\n. This is any incident where we require a coordinated response between teams. Again, this is just our definition at PagerDuty, feel free to use your own.\n\n\nThe intention behind this definition is that sometimes incidents can be handled by a single team, maybe the owners of a service that's having trouble. That rarely requires a large response in and of itself. But as soon as they need to involve another team, whether it's customer support, or database administrators, then we declare it to be a major incident and kick off a much larger response. The \ncoordination\n is key here, and we\u2019ll talk more about this later.\n\n\nBut this still covers quite a range of potential incidents. We can get more granular.\n\n\n\n\nSeverity Levels\n#\n\n\n\n\n008. Severity levels. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nWe also use \nseverity levels\n to determine how severe an incident is, and what type of response it gets. We use \nSEV-5\n through \nSEV-1\n for our levels, but you may use a different scheme, \nP0\n through \nP5\n, or maybe even emoji, \ud83d\udd25 through \ud83d\udca9, etc.\n\n\nLet's imagine you're looking at a graph of traffic to your website. You can typically determine severity based on how drastically your metrics are affected. So as your website traffic drops, the severity increases.\n\n\nYou will usually reach a point where you've set some predefined target or watermark, where as soon as the metric passes, you automatically consider something a major incident. At PagerDuty it's the difference between a \nSEV-3\n and \nSEV-2\n, but it may be different for your organization. Then as things get even more dire, we get into our \nSEV-2\n's and our \nSEV-1\n's when things completely flatline.\n\n\nHaving pre-defined thresholds and metrics can allow you to have automatic triggers for your response process.\n\n\nWe recommend using metrics tied to business impact.\nMetrics can be very useful, and often work best when they're tied to \nbusiness impact\n. For example, a metric we monitor at PagerDuty is \"number of outbound notifications per second\", at Amazon it could be \"number of orders per second\", at Netflix it might be \"stream starts per second\", etc. Monitoring these important business metrics will then let you use automation to determine the severity of an incident and the type of response you use.\n\n\nIf you use metrics that aren't tied to business impact (e.g. \"CPU usage is high on a host\"), then it's difficult, and sometimes impossible, to determine the severity of an incident associated with that metric.\n\n\nYou want to use a metric that lets you know how your business is doing, not how a particular piece of equipment is doing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyone Can Trigger Incident Response\n#\n\n\n\n\n009. Anyone can trigger incident response at any time.\n\n\nBut sometimes you won't know the impact straight away. Or maybe your metric hasn't reached the predefined threshold yet. We still need a way for a human to jump in and call something a major incident.\n\n\nSo even though we have automation at PagerDuty, we also have a mechanism whereby anyone can trigger our major incident response process at any time. This is very important for us. We've found that \nlowering the barrier to triggering incident response has lead to a dramatic increase in the speed with which incidents are resolved\n.\n\n\nWe don't want people to sit on something because the official alarm hasn't gone off yet. If customer support gets lots of requests very quickly, it's a good sign there's something wrong, and we need them to be able to raise the alarm. We've even had interns trigger our incident response process in their first week. If the janitor walks past a graph and thinks it looks wrong, I want them to be able to trigger incident response.\n\n\nWe were initially hesitant to introduce this, as we feared it would lead to lots of false positives. People triggering the alarm in an abundance of caution and it not really being an incident. But we've seen quite the opposite, people are pretty good at policing this themselves. Only twice have we had it be a false alarm, and both times it was warranted based on the information available at the time. Even if you do get a false positive now and then, you can use it as free practice.\n\n\n\n\nTriggering Incidents via Chat\n#\n\n\n\n\n010. Triggering incidents via chat. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nSo how do we let humans trigger the process? We do it with a \nchat command\n, but don\u2019t feel like that\u2019s the only right way. I just wanted to demonstrate how we do it to give you an idea. You can do it however your want. Air horn, flashing light in the office, hire a mariachi band, etc.\n\n\nThe point is you want a way to trigger your response that's fast, easy, and available to everyone.\n\n\n\n\nPeacetime vs Wartime\n#\n\n\n\n\n011. Peacetime vs Wartime. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nOnce an incident is triggered, we need to switch our mode of thinking. We need a \nmentality shift\n. We want a distinction between \u201cnormal operations\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s an incident in progress\u201d. We need to switch decision making from peacetime to wartime. From day-to-day operations, to defending the business.\n\n\nSomething that would be considered completely unacceptable during normal operations, such as deploying code without running any tests, might be perfectly acceptable during a major incident when you need to restore service quickly.\n\n\nThe way you operate, your role hierarchy, and the level of risk you\u2019re willing to take will all change as we make this shift.\n\n\n\n\nNormal vs Emergency\n#\n\n\n\n\n012. Normal vs Emergency. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nSome people don\u2019t like the peacetime/wartime analogy, so you can call it what you want. Normal/Emergency.\n\n\n\n\nOK vs Not OK\n#\n\n\n\n\n013. OK vs Not OK. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nOr OK/NOT OK. What you call it isn't as important as being able to make the mental shift.\n\n\n\n\nIncident Command System\n#\n\n\n\n\n014. Incident Command System (ICS). \nDocs Reference\n\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about our process a bit more. The way we do incident response at PagerDuty isn\u2019t something we invented ourselves, it is heavily based on the \nIncident Command System\n, usually abbreviated to ICS.\n\n\nICS was developed after some \ndevastating wildfires in Southern California\n in 1970. Thousands of firefighters responded, but found it difficult to work together. They knew how to fight fires individually, but lacked a common framework to work effectively as a larger group.\n\n\nAfter the fires, an interagency group called \nFIRESCOPE\n (Which believe it or not is an acronym for \"FIrefighting REsources of Southern California Organized for Potential Emergencies\") was formed and set out to develop two systems for managing wildland fire. One of those systems became known as ICS, and eventually became a national model for command structures at any major incident.\n\n\nIn 2004, the \nNational Incident Management System (NIMS)\n was established by FEMA, and is now used as the standard for emergency management by all public agencies in the United States. NIMS defines several operational systems as part of it, of which ICS is one.\n\n\nIt\u2019s used by everyone from the local fire department responding to a house fire, to the US government responding to a natural disaster. It provides a standardized response framework that everyone is familiar with.\n\n\nNIMS and ICS are the basis of the process we use at PagerDuty, however we have heavily modified it for our needs. Turns out that things can be streamlined a bit when human life isn't on the line.\n\n\n\n\nIncident Response Around The World\n#\n\n\n\n\n015. Incident response around the world. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nIt's worth noting that even though our process is based on the US systems, NIMS and ICS, there are many similar systems in use all over the world. While many are also based on ICS, some were developed separately, yet offer many of the same features.\n\n\nI particularly like \nthe UK system\n, simply because it has a role called the \"Gold Commander\", which just sounds like a Bond villain.\n\n\nWhen developing our process at PagerDuty, we looked at a few of the other systems in use around the world, and chose the bits we liked the most to add to our own.\n\n\nEmergency Management Around the World\nIf you're interested in learning more about the systems in use by other countries, we have \nlinks to some official resources\n.\n\n\nThere's also a book available from the US FEMA website, called \"\nComparative Emergency Management: Understanding Disaster Policies, Organizations, and Initiatives from Around the World\n\" where it compares the systems used by about 30 different countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoles\n#\n\n\n\n\n016. Roles of incident response.\n\n\nSo let's talk about the \nroles involved in our process\n. I'm going to introduce the roles one by one, but I don't want you to get scared by the number that will be on the slide by the end. We didn't start with this many roles, and we don't have people filling all the roles in every incident. This is just showing the available roles, and defining what they are. The process and roles will grow and shrink to fit the size of the incident at hand.\n\n\nWhile we don\u2019t use exactly the same roles as ICS, we picked out the ones that matter for us in order to get our role structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst up is the \nIncident Commander\n, usually abbreviated to IC. They're the person in charge and the most important role in the process. They make all the decisions, and all information flows up to them. What they say goes. I'm going to be talking more about this role in a moment, so we'll continue on with the others for now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext up we have the \nDeputy\n. This is basically a backup Incident Commander. They're training as an IC and will be listening to all the same information. They help to make sure nothing gets missed by the IC, and acts as a hot-swap standby should the IC want to handover command. This is one of those roles you won't need if you're just starting out. For a long time our Deputy and Scribe would be the same person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we have the \nScribe\n. The scribe's job is to keep an accurate timeline of events. What has happened, when it happened, and the key decisions that have been made. We use Slack for this, and the Scribe will be writing down notes into a Slack room, which gets us nicely timestamped data. It's worth noting that they're \nnot doing a direct dictation\n of a voice call. It's not \"John said this, Mary said this\". It's more like \"We're deciding between A and B, we've decided on A\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether, these roles are called the Command Staff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we have the \nCustomer Liaison\n. This is a member of our support team, and their job is to handle the two-way interaction with our customers. So they'll update customers as to what is going on, whether that's via email, tweet, or updating our status page. But they'll also let us know what customers are saying too. If we're getting 100's of support requests, or no one has raised a ticket at all. Since this can be useful information in tracking down a cause, and determining the level of risk we can take during our recovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nInternal Liaison\n is a relatively new role in our process. Their job is to handle all the interaction with internal teams, such as our executives, or our marketing teams, and so on. We have a separate Slack channel for incident updates, to which the Internal Liaison will post regular status updates, and answer any questions from the rest of the organization. This keeps those questions out of our main response, but allows people to still get answers. The internal liaison will also page other teams as necessary if they're needed on the response. Again, this isn't a role you'll need for most companies, for a while this was also handled by our Deputy/Scribe role.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether, these are the liaisons.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we have the \nSubject Matter Experts\n, or SME's. These are the people who will actually be fixing the problem. They'll be the ones logging into servers, changing code, and running commands.\n\n\n\n\nToday, I\u2019m going to focus on one role in particular, that of the Incident Commander.\n\n\n\n\nIncident Commander\n#\n\n\n\n\n017. Incident commander. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nThe incident commander is one of the most important roles you can have. Even if you don\u2019t have deputy, scribe, customer liaison, etc. The Incident Commander is one you should get first (well, after the SME\u2019s of course, you probably need someone to solve your problem before you need someone to coordinate the response).\n\n\n\n\nSingle Source of Truth\n#\n\n\n\n\n018. Single source of truth.\n\n\nThey\u2019re the single source of truth during an incident, and are the ones in charge. The big cheese. They make all decisions, and no action should be performed unless the IC has said so.\n\n\n\n\nHighest Ranking Person\n#\n\n\n\n\n019. Highest ranking person.\n\n\nNo matter their day-to-day role, and IC is always becomes the highest ranking person on the response. They're running the show. Remember what we talked about earlier with the mentality shift? Well, this is one of the things that will change during an incident.\n\n\nIs the Incident Commander a dictator?\nOnly in the sense that they are in charge and their decisions cannot be overruled. They do not rule by force, or go on power trips and order people around for the sake of it. A good Incident Commander will \nlisten\n to their experts and make the best decision they can based on the information available. Incident Commanders should show empathy towards all responders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigher than the CEO\n#\n\n\n\n\n020. Higher than the CEO.\n\n\nEven if the CEO joins the response, the IC still outranks them in an incident response situation. \nThis is absolutely critical for successful incident response, but it does require buy-in from your executives.\n Please don't surprise your CEO with this, it will not go well for you.\n\n\nWhether this works for you will depend on your organization. This is how we do it at PagerDuty and it works well for us, but I can imagine it not being easy to get this sort of buy-in in other organizations. I used to work in the airline industry, and I don't think this rule would fly there (Get it? Airline industry. Fly. Hello? This thing on?).\n\n\n\n\nNot a Resolver\n#\n\n\n\n\n021. Not a resolver.\n\n\nImportantly, the IC doesn't resolve the incident, they coordinate and delegate all tasks. They're the conductor of the orchestra, they're not playing an instrument. They're not acting as a resolver, and shouldn't be looking at graphs, or logging into servers.\n\n\nThis can be especially hard sometimes if the IC is an engineer in their day-to-day role, as they may naturally want to jump in to try and help, but that urge must be resisted if they're acting as an IC. If they absolutely are the only person who can solve the problem, then they should handover to another Incident Commander and assume the role of a Subject Matter Expert instead. We'll talk a bit more about this scenario later.\n\n\n\n\nBSOD\n#\n\n\n\n\n022. Uh oh!\n\n\nOh dear, that\u2019s not good. Did something go wrong? Seems we have ourselves an incident!\n\n\nSo what do you do when things break in the middle of the night? What's the first step to responding to an incident?\n\n\nIt turns out that the first step in any incident response is always the same, whether you're a small startup or a large enterprise. Whether there's 25 cents on the line, or 25 billion dollars.\n\n\n\n\nDon't Panic\n#\n\n\n\n\n023. Don't panic.\n\n\nDon\u2019t panic.\n It elevates stress, and causes others to panic. It\u2019ll end up hurting your incident response a lot more.\n\n\nIt's OK to panic on the inside.\n We're only human after all. It's a natural reaction to panic in these sorts of situations a little bit. Everything about getting paged is designed to get adrenaline flowing. Loud pager sounds and so on. Just try not to outwardly show panic, because it will cause others to do the same. Act calm, and others will follow suit.\n\n\nThose with experience will stay calm, and that can make the difference between a chaotic incident, and one that resolves smoothly. So don\u2019t panic!\n\n\n\n\nIC Introduction\n#\n\n\n\n\n024. \"Hi, I'm Rich, I'm the Incident Commander\". \nDocs Reference\n\n\nBut today we're lucky to have an IC here.\n\n\n\n\nHi, I'm Rich, I'm the Incident Commander.\n\n\n\n\nEvery call should start like this. Well, use your own name and not mine, but you get the idea.\n\n\nThere are a few important things here with the way I phrased this.\n\n\nWhat if you join a call and there's no IC?\nIt doesn't always work out that the first person to join the call is the incident commander. So what do you do in that case? Some guides will recommend the first person who joins acts as the Incident Commander, regardless of training. ICS usually works this way, where the first person on-site acts as the IC until someone more qualified arrives. We tried that and found it just doesn't work in practice. For example, let's say that the first person to join your response call becomes the acting IC. After an incident occurs, how long do you think it will be before one of your responders joins the call?\n\n\nYeah, turns out it's about 10 minutes. Because people are afraid of being the IC. You can't force someone to be an IC, and we prefer to make sure the acting IC at least has the training. It may add a few minutes to the start of an incident, but it makes it go smoother and quicker overall. If a trained IC joins the call and there's isn't an existing IC, they will take on the role. They ask \"Is there an IC on the call?.... hearing nothing, this is X, I'm the Incident Commander\".\n\n\nIt's also worth noting that the on-call IC doesn't automatically take over when they join. Whoever is the active IC on the call is in charge until they perform a handover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduce Yourself\n#\n\n\n\n\n025. Introduce yourself.\n\n\nFirstly, I introduced myself by name. I didn't just say \"Hi, I'm the IC\". I'm not an emotionless robot.\n\n\nIntroductions are important so that people know who you are. They\u2019ll usually be referring to you as \"IC\", rather than by name, but it still humanizes you more. If you introduce yourself by name people will treat you differently and it'll help to make things go a little bit smoother.\n\n\nYou\u2019ll find soon that a lot of the job of an IC involves psychology and phrasing more than technical expertise.\n\n\n\n\nSay Incident Commander\n#\n\n\n\n\n026. Say \"Incident Commander\".\n\n\nThen I said that I'm the \"Incident Commander\". I didn't abbreviate to IC, since new people might not understand the lingo yet. Stating it that way made it very clear. We want to make sure we \nalways use clear language\n. Additionally, saying the word \"Commander\" here will subconsciously instill in people that you're in charge.\n\n\n\n\nGood Communication\n#\n\n\n\n\n027. Good communication is essential.\n\n\nGood communication is essential. A breakdown in communication can hamper the entire response process. One of your jobs as an IC is to keep the lines of communication clear and maintain discipline. Don\u2019t throw weird or unfamiliar acronyms into the discussion.\n\n\n\n\nAcronym Overload\n#\n\n\n\n\n028. Acronym overload.\n\n\nToo many acronyms and internal lingo will upset newcomers and adds cognitive overhead. As shown in this completely realistic example.\n\n\nIt takes much longer to say \"Let's get the Incident Commander on the response call, then get a bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwich for all the Subject Matter Experts\". But it's much clearer what is being asked for.\n\n\n\n\nClear is Better Than Concise\n#\n\n\n\n\n029. Clear is better than concise. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nClear instructions are more important than concise instructions. You want to \nfavor explicit and clear communication over all else\n. If you have the choice between taking 5 seconds and abbreviating, or taking 30 seconds and making it clear, take 30 seconds. Don\u2019t give a long essay, but make sure the instructions are unambiguous.\n\n\nThere's a tendency to want to rush through an incident, that every second counts, and that you need to use abbreviations to get the fastest possible response. Unfortunately you'll find that using unfamiliar and unclear language will almost always prolong an incident.\n\n\n\n\nWhat's Wrong?\n#\n\n\n\n\n030. What's wrong? \nDocs Reference\n\n\nOK, so how do we actually start solving our problem?\n\n\nThe first step is to collect information from your Subject Matter Experts (SME) for their services/area of ownership. Ask what's wrong, and gather the symptoms of the incident. Is it only affecting one system? Is it affecting everything? Was there a specific metric that triggered an alarm?\n\n\nWe call this \u201c\nsizing up\n\u201d. We're trying to get an idea of the scope of the incident.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Actions Can We Take?\n#\n\n\n\n\n031. What actions can we take? \nDocs Reference\n\n\nNext we want to ask our experts what they want to do to fix their systems. Remember, the IC isn't coming up with solutions, we want to ask the people who are the experts for their services what they want to do to. They will have a much better idea of the actions that can be taken. We want to collect proposed repair actions.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Risks Are Involved?\n#\n\n\n\n\n032. What are the risks involved?\n\n\nImportantly, we also want to make sure we ask what risks are involved with the proposed actions. \"What impact will that have?\", \"What are the risks involved?\", \"How confident are you it will work?\".\n\n\nWithout this information, we can't make an informed decision. For example, if we need to restart our servers to fix a problem, we could either reboot them all at once and be done in 30 seconds, or we could do a rolling restart and take 10 minutes. On the surface of it, the first option sounds like the best.\n\n\nBut, if we ask for the risks involved, we'll learn that the first option will cause downtime for everyone in those 30s, whereas the second option, while slower, will result in no downtime for end users. This can change the decision you make, so it's important to get the information.\n\n\n\n\nMake a Decision\n#\n\n\n\n\n033. Make a decision.\n\n\nOnce we have a collection of actions and their associated risks, it's time to make a decision. Sometimes there's an obvious path forward, with one option being clearly better. But sometimes you're presented with two equally bad options.\n\n\nThere\u2019s no golden rule here I can give you, it\u2019ll be up to context and your company culture. But my advice if you can't decide between two options is to literally flip a coin. \nMaking the wrong decision is better than making no decision.\n Making no decision doesn't help to make forward progress, you learn nothing new and the incident is still going on. Making a decision, even if it's the \"wrong\" one will give you more information. If it turns out to be wrong, you can then put all your resources into the other option.\n\n\nA wrong decision gives you more useful information, making no decision gives you nothing. You want to avoid \ndecision paralysis\n at all costs, as it can prolong your incident further.\n\n\n'Do nothing' is an acceptable decision.\nI should note that the above advice is intended for the situation when you can't decide between two options. \"Do nothing\" is a perfectly acceptable decision if that's the course of action you want to take. It is sometimes appropriate to get more information by waiting and seeing what changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGain Consensus\n#\n\n\n\n\n034. Gain consensus.\n\n\nOnce we've made a decision, we need to gain consensus for our plan. But wait, why? Didn't I say earlier that the IC is basically a dictator and everyone should follow their instructions? While technically true, we want to be sure we give a chance to listen to any potential problems our experts may have with the plan. We don't want people to come back later and say things like \"I knew that wouldn't work\". We want to make sure we stop the \nhindsight 20/20 problem\n. It demotivates responders, and wastes time.\n\n\nBut gaining consensus amongst a large group of people can be a bit difficult.\n\n\n\n\nBlue Background\n#\n\n\n\n\n035. This background is blue.\n\n\nLet's look at a quick example to show what I mean,\n\n\n\n\nI propose that this background is blue. Does everyone agree?\n\n\n\n\nAudience participation!\nThis is where I would usually get few people from the audience nodding or quietly saying \"Yes\". I'll point to about 5 or 6 people who did nothing and ask them one by one if they agree. Until it gets uncomfortable.\n\n\n\n\nSee how long it\u2019s taking us to reach consensus? \nDistributed consensus is hard\n, you\u2019ll be there forever trying to agree on the proposed actions.\n\n\nLet's try it a different way,\n\n\n\n\nI propose that this background is blue. Are there any strong objections? ... Hearing none, the background is blue, let's proceed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny Strong Objections?\n#\n\n\n\n\n036. Are there any strong objections? \nDocs Reference\n\n\nSee how much faster that was? I \nimplicitly got the consensus of everyone in the room\n, so none of you could come back later and say you didn't think the background was blue, because I gave you all a chance to object.\n\n\nDoing it this way optimizes for the 99% case. Most of the time there won\u2019t be any objections and you can just continue. But likewise, we don't really care if people agree with us. We care if people \ndisagree\n, that's the information we need the most. If you ask everyone to agree, you may get one person saying \"No\" with a really important point, but you can't hear them because everyone else is saying \"Yes\".\n\n\n\n\nStrong\n#\n\n\n\n\n037. STRONG objections.\n\n\nThis is one of the most useful phrases in your toolkit as an IC as it allows you to get consensus on a decision very quickly, and prevents the hindsight problem from popping up later. The way we phrased it though is important, the word \"\nstrong\n\" subconsciously instills in people that we're still in an incident situation, and normal concerns might not apply.\n\n\nMake sure to leave enough of a pause for people to raise any objections they may have. It's no good asking for strong objections then moving on. All responders need to have the opportunity to raise a concern.\n\n\nSo now that we have consensus, we need to execute the plan, that means assigning the task to someone. Before we do that though, I have a quick question.\n\n\n\n\nHow Long Have I Been Talking?\n#\n\n\n\n\n038. How long have I been talking?\n\n\nAt the start, I asked if someone could keep track of the time for me. Did anyone actually do that? Can anyone tell me exactly how long I've been talking?\n\n\nProbably not. But why not? I clearly asked.\n\n\nIt's likely because of how I phrased the question.\n\n\n\n\nBystander Effect\n#\n\n\n\n\n039. Bystander effect.\n\n\nI said \"Can someone...\". This is called the \nbystander effect\n. Everyone assumed someone else was doing it, so no one ended up doing it. If by some chance, someone actually did do it, you won't know who it is anyway, or if they've even started.\n\n\nA good example of this is if there's a medical emergency, and you shout \"Somebody call 911!\", you'll find that no one does, because everyone assumes someone else is doing it. If you're ever in that situation, you want to point to someone and say \"You, call 911\". Then it'll get done.\n\n\nLocalization\nIf you're outside the US, substitute 911 for whatever your local emergency number is. You probably don't want to be shouting \"You, call 911\" if you're in Europe for example.\n\n\n\n\nSo what I should've done was point to someone in the room and say,\n\n\n\n\nYou, please keep track of the time and give me a little wave when we get to 30 minutes, starting now. Understood?\n\n\n\n\nSee how different that was?\n\n\n\n\nAssigning Tasks\n#\n\n\n\n\n040. Assigning tasks. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nIn the context of an incident, that might look like this. It's a little more verbose than \"Can someone investigate the cause?\", but it's a lot clearer what I want to happen. Brings us back to clear is better than concise from earlier.\n\n\nSeveral important things happened in this exchange as I was assigning the task.\n\n\n\n\nAssign Specific People\n#\n\n\n\n\n041. Assign tasks to a specific person.\n\n\nFirst, the task was assigned \ndirectly to a specific person\n. It\u2019s ok to assign it to a role to \u201cDBA on-call\u2026\u201d, etc. But it must be a single individual. Don't assign things to a group, because they won't get done.\n\n\n\n\nTime Limit\n#\n\n\n\n\n042. Time-box all tasks.\n\n\nSecond, the task was given a time-limit. This means the SME knows exactly how long until I come back to them for an answer, so they won\u2019t be surprised or caught off guard. It sets the expectations.\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgement\n#\n\n\n\n\n043. Get acknowledgement.\n\n\nFinally, I confirmed that they had understood the instructions and are going to carry them out. So I don\u2019t come back in 5 minutes and find they never started, or have additional questions.\n\n\n\n\nFollowup\n#\n\n\n\n\n044. Followup.\n\n\nThen after the time is up, we can simply ask for the results of their task. Of course they will always have the right answer the first time and will never need any additional time to investigate, right?\n\n\n\n\nNeed More Time?\n#\n\n\n\n\n045. What if they need more time?\n\n\nIt's not always going to be the case that things get done within the timeframe. So what do you do if, after 5 minutes, they need more time?\n\n\nDon\u2019t just give them another arbitrary time limit, because they\u2019ll keep coming back and you\u2019re just going to be wasting time giving them 5 minutes chunks for an hour. Instead, ask your experts how long they need.\n\n\n\n\nMore Time\n#\n\n\n\n\n046. More time.\n\n\nThis isn't going to be like in the movies, where you ask how long someone needs, they say two hours and you slam you fist on a table and say \"You've got one!\". You need to \ntrust in your experts\n to give you accurate estimates, and give them the time they need. Putting people under unreasonable pressure is only going to lead to mistakes being made.\n\n\nYou can do this the first time too.\nYou can also just ask your experts how long they need the first time you hand out the task instead of picking a time yourself. Sometimes we've found it easier to give a time-limit ourselves if it's an action that's been done before and we have a rough idea of how long it should take. But there's nothing wrong with asking how long someone needs as you assign the task either.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolving Incidents (1)\n#\n\n\n\n\n047. Flow chart for solving incidents.\n\n\nAnd we just keep following this pattern until the incident is resolved.\n\n\n\n\nAsk for a status from your experts.\n\n\nDecide on an action based on what you\u2019re told, gaining consensus for the plan.\n\n\nAssign the task out.\n\n\nFollow up with the tasks once done, and repeat if there are still problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolving Incidents (2)\n#\n\n\n\n\n048. Another flow chart for solving incidents..\n\n\nMore generally, we\u2019re following \nthis cycle\n for each incident. We size-up the situation, stabilize things (that's the loop we just showed), keep everyone updated as to what's going on, then verify the situation is fixed before ending the response. If it's not fixed, we start again.\n\n\n\n\nIgnore the IC\n#\n\n\n\n\n049. \"Ignore the IC, do what I say!\"\n\n\nUh oh, an executive has joined the response and is trying to override the IC\u2019s decisions. That\u2019s not great.\n\n\nRemember that the IC is the ultimate authority in incident response, their decisions are the ones that matter. So how do you handle the awkward situation when someone tries to override those decisions?\n\n\nWe have a top tip here, a great question to keep in your tool belt as an incident commander. A simple question that can immediately diffuse this situation.\n\n\n\n\nDo You Wish To Take Command?\n#\n\n\n\n\n050. Do you wish to take command? \nDocs Reference\n\n\n\n\nDo you wish to take command?\n\n\n\n\nWatch how quickly they don\u2019t answer with \u201cyes\u201d.\n\n\nIf they do, great! You\u2019re off the hook and can respond with,\n\n\n\n\nUnderstood. Everyone on the call be advised, I'm handing over command to executive A. They are now the Incident Commander.\n\n\n\n\nBut most of the time they\u2019ll say either say \"No\"\", or not answer at all, in which case you can continue on as normal, perhaps saying,\n\n\n\n\nIn that case, please cause no further interruptions or I will have to remove you from the call.\n\n\n\n\nBut \"Do you wish to take command?\" is the most useful phrase for dealing with that kind of executive hostile takeover.\n\n\n\n\nExecutive Swoop\n#\n\n\n\n\n051. Executive swoop.\n\n\nThis is a class of problem we call Executive Swoop. Well, actually it's \"Executive Swoop and Poop\", but I was asked not to put that on the slide.\n\n\nThe previous example isn't typical though. It's rare for someone to come in and purposefully start causing a problem like that.\n\n\nWe're going to look at some more common examples of executive swoop next, but it's worth noting that \nnone of these happen maliciously\n. No executive joins with the intent of hindering the process, they\u2019re trying to motivate people and find out what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s their business too! Making sure your executives understand why these things are a problem is important, so be sure to followup after an incident if these things happen.\n\n\n\n\nLet's Resolve This in 10 Minutes\n#\n\n\n\n\n052. Let's try and resolve this in 10 minutes.\n\n\n\n\nLet's try and resolve this in 10 minutes please!\n\n\n\n\nThis one definitely wasn't said by anyone at PagerDuty ever. Nope. Definitely not.\n\n\nOn the surface this seems pretty benign. The executive is merely trying to motivate staff and encourage them to solve the problem quickly, right?\n\n\nUnfortunately, that's not how others on the call are going to interpret it. Instead they're more likely to be sarcastically thinking \"Well, I was going to take an hour, but since you've said that, OK I'll do it in 10 minutes\". It assumes people aren\u2019t already working as hard as possible to solve the problem. It demotivates responders, and adds additional stress.\n\n\nYour job as IC is to nip this in the bud and keep things on track.\n\n\n\n\nKeep Comments Until The End\n#\n\n\n\n\n053. Keep your comments until the end. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nTo keep things moving, you need to remind the executive of what's going on, and direct questions to be handled at a later time. It may come across slightly abrupt, but it gets the point across quickly and allows you to keep moving. Most people will pick up on the subtext here.\n\n\n\n\nWe're in the middle of an incident, please keep your comments until the end.\n\n\n\n\nRemember, \ndon't be mean\n, just state the facts and keep things flowing. We're not trying to shame people or make them feel bad, we're trying to keep our incident moving towards a resolution.\n\n\n\n\nSpreadsheet of Affected Customers\n#\n\n\n\n\n054. Can I get a spreadsheet of affected customers?\n\n\n\n\nCan I get a spreadsheet of all affected customers?\n\n\n\n\nAnother one that's definitely never been mentioned on any PagerDuty incident response call ever.\n\n\nAn exec joins the call and wants to get a list of impacted customers. The problem is that in order to find that out, we'll need to take someone away from the effort of responding to the incident, at a time when we need them most. If you can spare the resources, then feel free to dedicate some to finding the information. But more often than not you wont have the resources to spare. So we can just tell the executive that.\n\n\n\n\nThe Incident Takes Priority\n#\n\n\n\n\n055. The incident takes priority. \nDocs Reference\n\n\n\n\nWe can either get you that list, or fix the incident. Not both. The incident takes priority.\n\n\n\n\nNote how this isn't phrased as a question, it wasn't \"We can either get you that list or fix the incident, which do you want?\". The \nincident commander has already made the decision\n, they're simply letting the executive know what it is.\n\n\nRemember that the IC is still in charge, you don't want to cede decision making to someone else during an incident.\n\n\n\n\nReally a SEV-1?\n#\n\n\n\n\n056. Is this really a SEV-1?\n\n\n\n\nIs this really a SEV-1?\n\n\n\n\nOh look, it's another one that's never ever happened at PagerDuty. We used to have a really big problem with this one. We'd start incident response calls, then spend the first 10 minutes arguing over whether it was a \nSEV-3\n or a \nSEV-2\n. By the time we were finished, we would be 10 minutes into a \nSEV-1\n and have made no progress.\n\n\nSo now we have a rule. We don't discuss incident severity during the call. If we can't decide between two, we always assume it's the higher severity and move on.\n\n\nDon't litigate severities during an incident. It's a waste of time.\n\n\n\n\nTreating as a SEV-1\n#\n\n\n\n\n057. We're treating this as a SEV-1. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nSo the IC will need to make it clear we don\u2019t discuss, and that we\u2019re treating it as a \nSEV-1\n. It may turn out to be a \nSEV-4\n, who knows, it doesn\u2019t matter. That's a discussion for the post-mortem.\n\n\n\n\nWe do not discuss incident severity during the call. We're treating this as a SEV-1.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you\u2019ve spun up the gears of incident response, you may as well finish the process, if anything it just gives you all more practice.\n\n\n\n\nNotify Stakeholders\n#\n\n\n\n\n058. Notify stakeholders.\n\n\nPretty much all of these examples of executive swoop can be pre-empted by \ninvolving stakeholders in the process\n, giving them a way to stay up to date.\n\n\nAt PagerDuty we have a separate Slack room just for incident updates. It's less noisy than our main response room, and gives succinct updates for folks who want it. This allows execs to stay in the loop, and also ask questions without affecting the main response. In our process, the Internal Liaison is responsible for monitoring and updating that channel.\n\n\nStakeholders are not allowed to talk on our response call, or in our main incident response chat room. They must take all discussion to the updates room or via the Internal Liaison. The Incident Commander is responsible for keeping our primary communication channels free of those types of discussions or questions, and direct people towards the Internal Liaison.\n\n\n\n\nBelligerent Responder\n#\n\n\n\n\n059. The belligerent responder.\n\n\nThere are other things than can hinder your response though that don't fall under the category of executive swoop. This one we call the belligerent responder. It was originally called \nThe Drunk Engineer\n, but again, I was asked not to put that in the slide.\n\n\nThere are plenty of awkward situations that can present themselves on response calls. There can be big ego\u2019s and strong opinions. What do you do when someone on the call is being belligerent and hampering the response process?\n\n\nYou need to be firm, and let them know what will happen if they continue.\n\n\n\n\nDisruptive\n#\n\n\n\n\n060. You're being disruptive. \nDocs Reference\n\n\n\n\nYou're being disruptive. Please stop, or I will have to remove you from the call.\n\n\n\n\nState the facts, \ngive them a way out to save face\n, but state what will happen if they don\u2019t. No second chances, follow through on the action if they don\u2019t respond. It can be harsh, but that\u2019s what needs to be done.\n\n\nAgain, we've phrased this in a particular way. We said \"I will have to remove you\", rather than \"I will remove you\". It makes it seem like the decision is out of your hands and that you'll be forced to do it. It can make it less personal and less likely to cause awkward problems after the call is over.\n\n\n\n\nDo Responders Get Tired?\n#\n\n\n\n\n061. Do responders get tired?\n\n\nAnother problem that can pop up during a response is when we have long running incidents.\n\n\nDo we use the same IC for a 12 hour incident? Do IC's even get tired? Well, of course they do! They're people too. This is another human cost associated with incident response that you want to try and minimize.\n\n\nAll of the roles in the response process can be mentally fatiguing. When you get tired you start to forget things and make mistakes, so it's important to try and keep a fresh perspective as often as you can.\n\n\n\n\nHandovers Are Encouraged\n#\n\n\n\n\n062. Handovers are encouraged.\n\n\nFor this reason, we \nactively encourage handovers\n in our process. Usually every hour or so is what we recommend, but it's at the discretion of the people involved. 3 hours would be the absolute upper limit where we would start requiring a handover.\n\n\nMake sure to rest after handing over.\nIt can be very tempting after handing over command to want to stay on the call and listen in, to try and stay on top of things and see how things are going. \nAvoid this at all costs.\n Once handing over your role to someone else, you should leave the response call and all associated chat rooms. Take a break away from anything related to the incident.\n\n\nYou may be required to take the role again later if the incident is very long running. If you've stayed listening in the entire time, then while you would be up to speed, you would still be fatigued and would not be able to respond as efficient as if you'd taken a real break.\n\n\n\n\nHanding over command is important, and really easy. Get the new IC up to speed out-of-band from the main discussion. We privately message on Slack for example. If you have a deputy, then it's even better, because they would already be on the call and up to speed.\n\n\nThen you handover.\n\n\n\n\nHandover\n#\n\n\n\n\n063. Handover. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nState that you are handing over command, and then the new IC begins as if it were a new call. Simple!\n\n\nSince we want to be able to handover, it's important to have as many trained IC's as you can. The more you have, the better. Ideally you want enough for at least a daily rotation.\n\n\nHow do you get lots of trained Incident Commands?\nThis is a question we get a lot, and not something we have a golden solution for. Many people are hesitant to take on the responsibilities of being an IC in addition to their current work and on-call responsibilities, which is a perfectly valid concern. One of the best ways we found to increase the pool of Incident Commanders is to encourage folks outside of normal engineering teams to take on the role. Those who wouldn't normally be part of an on-call rotation. Not only can they provide an outside perspective during incidents that is sometimes missing, but it can also help to build further empathy with others in the organization who regularly go on-call.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnti-Patterns\n#\n\n\n\n\n064. Anti-Patterns. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nLet\u2019s talk about some \nanti-patterns\n. Things which seem like they would help incident response, but really don\u2019t. Knowing these now will save you the headaches and growing pains we went through.\n\n\n\n\nGetting Everyone on the Call\n#\n\n\n\n\n065. Getting everyone on the call. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nBelieve it or not, we used to page every single engineer at PagerDuty whenever we had a \nSEV-2\n. I'm not joking. It was horrible. It worked great when we only had 5 engineers, less so when we had 50.\n\n\nIt's important to \nmaintain an effective \nspan of control\n during an incident. No one person should have more than ~7 people reporting to them. Any more than that and you have too many cooks in the kitchen.\n\n\nWaking up 30 engineers at 3am causes untold damage. Please don't do it.\n\n\n\n\nNot Letting Responders Leave\n#\n\n\n\n\n066. Not letting responders leave. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nRemember I mentioned at the beginning that one of our goals is to reduce the cost associated with an incident? That includes the human cost. Waking people up at 3am is costly. But keeping those people on a call in which they can\u2019t do anything is even worse.\n\n\nSo if some responders are no longer needed, let them leave the call. Your co-workers time is more costly than servers, don\u2019t burn them out!\n\n\nI would recommend you not list everyone you want to leave the call, since you might miss people. Better to say who you want to stay, that way it also solidifies who you want to stay too. For example,\n\n\n\n\nOperations, Support, and Rich, please stay on the call. Everyone else, feel free to drop off at your discretion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToo Frequent Status Updates\n#\n\n\n\n\n067. Too frequent status updates. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nExecutives especially love frequent status updates. But providing them too frequently can cause things to get out of hand. If it takes 5 minutes to write an update, and they want an update every 5 minutes, you can start to see how long it's going to take to solve the incident.\n\n\nAt PagerDuty, we keep our internal updates to about once every 20-30 minutes. Writing the update takes away time from solving the incident, so that needs to be balanced. This cadence has worked well for us.\n\n\n\n\nBeing Overly Focussed On An Issue\n#\n\n\n\n\n068. Being overly focussed on an issue. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nThe IC is generally the person who has the bigger picture of what's going on. But there can be a tendency for responders to become too focussed on the problem they see in front of them, rather than taking the bigger picture into account.\n\n\nThis usually presents itself on an incident call with an SME constantly bringing up the same issue without listening to instructions from the incident commander, and having tunnel vision for the specific issue on their system.\n\n\nTry not to get tunnel vision or chase red herrings. Always keep the bigger picture in mind.\n\n\n\n\nRequiring Deeply Technical ICs\n#\n\n\n\n\n069. Requiring deeply technical incident commanders. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nWe used to require that all of our Incident Commanders be experienced engineers with deep technical knowledge of all PagerDuty systems. \nThis was one of our bigger mistakes.\n Remember that IC's aren't responders, they aren't the ones actually fixing the problem, so they don't need deep technical knowledge. IC's are experts at coordinating the response, not at solving technical issues. You should be relying on your SMEs for that.\n\n\nRemoving the restriction on technical knowledge led to a dramatic increase in our pool of available incident commanders\n, and didn't have any effect on our ability to respond to incidents. We now have ICs from all across the organization, with even more currently in training.\n\n\nIt's already hard enough to get people to want to be an IC, so don't add further unnecessary restrictions to your pool.\n\n\n\n\nTaking on Multiple Roles\n#\n\n\n\n\n070. Taking on multiple roles. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nIn past PagerDuty incidents, we've had instances where the Incident Commander has started to assume the Subject Matter Expert role and attempted to solve the problem themselves. This typically happens when an engineer is the IC, and the incident is something to do with a system they helped to build. It's very tempting to say \"I know how to fix this!\" and jump in and solve the problem yourself. But you cannot do that as an IC.\n\n\nInevitably, the incident will be bigger than you think, and while you're trying to fix you little fire, there's another one happening in another service and you've lost sight of the bigger picture.\n\n\nYou cannot take on another role at the same time as being an Incident Commander. If you absolutely are the only person who can solve the problem, then handover to another IC and assume the role of an SME for the remainder of the incident.\n\n\n\n\nLitigating Policy\n#\n\n\n\n\n071. Litigating policy during an incident. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nJust like with severities, policy and processes should not be discussed during an incident. The current process should be followed, and any concerns should be raised afterwards, either during a post-mortem or directly to the team managing the incident response process.\n\n\nTrying to change the process during an incident is only going to prolong the current incident. That's not the time to have that discussion.\n\n\n\n\nAverse to Process Changes\n#\n\n\n\n\n072. Being averse to process changes. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nFinally, once a stable process is in place and incidents are getting resolved, there can be lots of hesitation and resistance to changing that process. \"If it ain't broke don't fix it\". As your company grows, your response will need to change. Holding on to your old processes and practices for too long can hinder your incident response going forward. Don't be reckless, of course, but try to introduce sensible changes and don't be afraid to make changes which might slow things down in the short-term, but will make things faster in the long-run. These are the hardest changes to make, but ultimately the most worthwhile.\n\n\n\n\nResolved\n#\n\n\n\n\n073. Resolved.\n\n\nOK, so if all goes well, you're incident will get resolved. That means we're all done and we can go home, right?!\n\n\nWell, not quite yet. There's still one more thing we need to do.\n\n\n\n\nDon't Neglect The Post-Mortem\n#\n\n\n\n\n074. Don't neglect the post-mortem. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nWe need to do a \npost-mortem\n. Or after-action review, learning review, retrospective, incident report, etc. Whatever you want to call it, the name doesn't matter as much as actually doing one!\n\n\nDon't make the mistake of neglecting a post-mortem after an incident. Without a post-mortem you fail to recognize what you're doing right, where you could improve, and most importantly, how to avoid making the same exact mistakes next time around. A well-designed, blameless post-mortem allows teams to continuously learn, and serves as a way to iteratively improve your infrastructure and incident response process.\n\n\nPost-mortems are an important followup action and should never be missed. Even if you triggered an incident and then decided it was a false alarm, you should still do a brief post-mortem. You just mobilized a response when you didn't need to, so you want to identify how you can make sure that doesn't happen again.\n\n\n\n\nCreate the Post-Mortem\n#\n\n\n\n\n075. Create the post-mortem. \nDocs Reference\n\n\nThe first step is to create the post-mortem itself. This is the job of the Incident Commander. I don't mean they're going to write the entire post-mortem, they're just going to create the \ninitial template\n. We want to make sure that a link exists so that when people ask \"When will we know what went wrong?\" you have something to give them.\n\n\n\n\nPick an Owner\n#\n\n\n\n\n076. Pick an owner.\n\n\nThen the IC needs to assign an owner. Remember how we assigned tasks to specific individuals? It\u2019s no different with a post-mortem. Make sure there\u2019s a clear owner, and that it's an \nindividual\n and not a team. The most surefire way to make sure a post-mortem doesn't get completed is to assign it to a team instead of a specific person.\n\n\nThe person you assign is responsible for completing the post-mortem, but they don't have to do it all themselves. They can delegate out sections as they see fit. But you need someone on the hook for making sure it gets finished.\n\n\nAs with assigning other tasks, you also want to give them a deadline, and make sure they've understood that they're responsible for completing the post-mortem.\n\n\n\n\nBlameless\n#\n\n\n\n\n077. Blameless.\n\n\nImportantly, post-mortems need to be \nblameless\n. If someone made a mistake, you just spent lots of money training them to never do it again. \nYou can\u2019t fire your way to reliability.\n\n\nLet's say Bob ran a command which deleted your entire database. Your post-mortem shouldn't be \"Bob made a mistake and should be fired or have his access revoked!\". The post-mortem should be \"Why is our system configured in a way which  allowed a single user to delete the entire database?\".\n\n\nIf you name and shame people in a post-mortem, it demotivates everyone. Next time someone makes a mistake, they're not going to own up to it, because they'll be afraid of getting shamed too. You want people to bring up problems, because then you get to fix them quickly.\n\n\n\n\nReview the Process\n#\n\n\n\n\n078. Review the process too!\n\n\nDon\u2019t forget to also review the process as part of the post-mortem. How can you change the process to make it better? What isn\u2019t working out well? Just as it\u2019s important to learn from and fix mistakes in your software, you want to do the same for your incident response process.\n\n\n\n\nPractice\n#\n\n\n\n\n079. Practice makes perfect.\n\n\nFinally, you want to practice your incident response process as much as you can. \nYou don't want to be doing it for the first time during a real incident.\n Reading about it is one thing, but going through the motions is very different.\n\n\nStart by running mock incidents. Then treat your smaller incidents as if they're larger ones. If you trigger incident response and find it's not a real incident, treat it like one anyway since it's free practice.\n\n\nAt PagerDuty, we run something called \nFailure Friday\n where we purposefully inject failure into our systems to test their resilience. We treat this like a major incident, with an incident commander and everything. It allows us to practice while we're not under the stress of a normal incident.\n\n\nWe also play a game called \nKeep Talking And Nobody Explodes\n. Yes, that's right, we play video games at work. But we've found that this game really helps to simulate a lot of the things an incident commander has to deal with, and is a great way to get some stress free practice.\n\n\nThe bottom line is to practice as much as you can, so that when you do have the inevitable incident, your response is just routine.\n\n\n\n\nOpen-Source Response Docs\n#\n\n\n\n\n080. Our open-source incident response documentation.\n\n\nThis was just a brief taste of the training we run at PagerDuty for our own Incident Commanders. We had nowhere near enough time to cover everything.\n\n\nGood news though! We have published our entire incident response process online. It is an exact copy of our internal documentation only with things like phone numbers removed. It's complete free to use, and is open-sourced under an Apache 2 license so you can use it in your own organizations. \nIt's on GitHub\n and we do accept pull requests if you spot any mistakes or have improvement suggestions.\n\n\nEverything I've talked about today can be found in the documentation, and there's lots of great \nadditional reading material\n if you want to learn more.\n\n\n\n\nResponse Docs Image\n#\n\n\n\n\n081. Response docs screenshot.\n\n\nIt looks pretty too.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n#\n\n\n\n\n082. Summary.\n\n\nIncident command training is useful in so many situations outside of a server exploding in the night. It can be applicable to many different things in your life, whether it's staying calm after a fender bender on the highway, or jumping into action to help during a major natural disaster. You'd be surprised at how useful it can be in everyday life.\n\n\nI even wrote a slightly tongue-in-cheek blog post called \"\nBabyDuty or: How PagerDuty Accidentally Prepared me for Fatherhood\n\" where I compared childbirth to a major incident, and the role of a parent with that of an Incident Commander. Though the older my daughter gets, the more I'm starting to realize it perhaps wasn't quite as tongue-in-cheek as I first thought.\n\n\nAnyway, with that, I'll leave you with a quick summary of the main things we discussed today.

We want less of the latter, and more of the former. We want to replace chaos with calm. Panic and chaos are not good during an incident, they only exacerbate things and causes more confusion.

Docs Reference  So when we talk about incident response, what we're really talking about is an organized approach to addressing and managing an incident. This is how we define incident response at PagerDuty. They key here is on the word  organized . We don't want to be running around in a panic anytime an alert goes off. We want our response to be almost routine, and for everyone to work together like a well-oiled machine.  There's a quote I really like from an excellent book called  Incident Management for Operations  that's appropriate here,   Fire is not an emergency to the fire department . . .

Give a thousand monkeys a keyboard and enough time and they can probably solve your problem. That's not good incident response. We want to solve the problem in a way which limits the damage caused, and reduces the recovery time and costs. I don\u2019t just mean  financial  cost either, there\u2019s a cost associated with engineer health too. Constantly waking people up at 3am can have a dramatic negative effect on their health and happiness.  If financial impact is all you care about though, let's not forget that  people are expensive . In a large organization, a phone bridge with 100 people sitting there mostly idle for several hours is not unheard of. If each of those people cost ~$100/hour, that\u2019s $10K every hour! That\u2019s  really  expensive to the business.",

It sounds silly, but if you\u2019re not sure whether something\u2019s an incident, you don\u2019t know whether to respond to it.  Here is PagerDuty\u2019s definition of an incident,   An unplanned disruption or degradation of service that is actively affecting customers' ability to use the product.   \"Customers\" here doesn't just refer to external customers, but can refer to internal customers too.  Your definition might be different, and that\u2019s OK. I just wanted to give you an idea of the kind of definition that can get you started. You want your definition to be simple, no more than a sentence, and easily understood by anyone.  You may notice that this is quite a broad definition though.

Again, this is just our definition at PagerDuty, feel free to use your own.  The intention behind this definition is that sometimes incidents can be handled by a single team, maybe the owners of a service that's having trouble. That rarely requires a large response in and of itself. But as soon as they need to involve another team, whether it's customer support, or database administrators, then we declare it to be a major incident and kick off a much larger response. The  coordination  is key here, and we\u2019ll talk more about this later.  But this still covers quite a range of potential incidents. We can get more granular.",

We use  SEV-5  through  SEV-1  for our levels, but you may use a different scheme,  P0  through  P5 , or maybe even emoji, \ud83d\udd25 through \ud83d\udca9, etc.  Let's imagine you're looking at a graph of traffic to your website. You can typically determine severity based on how drastically your metrics are affected. So as your website traffic drops, the severity increases.  You will usually reach a point where you've set some predefined target or watermark, where as soon as the metric passes, you automatically consider something a major incident. At PagerDuty it's the difference between a  SEV-3  and  SEV-2 , but it may be different for your organization. Then as things get even more dire, we get into our  SEV-2 's and our  SEV-1 's when things completely flatline.  Having pre-defined thresholds and metrics can allow you to have automatic triggers for your response process.  We recommend using metrics tied to business impact. Metrics can be very useful, and often work best when they're tied to  business impact . For example, a metric we monitor at PagerDuty is \"number of outbound notifications per second\", at Amazon it could be \"number of orders per second\", at Netflix it might be \"stream starts per second\", etc. Monitoring these important business metrics will then let you use automation to determine the severity of an incident and the type of response you use.  If you use metrics that aren't tied to business impact (e.g. \"CPU usage is high on a host\"), then it's difficult, and sometimes impossible, to determine the severity of an incident associated with that metric.  You want to use a metric that lets you know how your business is doing, not how a particular piece of equipment is doing.",

So even though we have automation at PagerDuty, we also have a mechanism whereby anyone can trigger our major incident response process at any time. This is very important for us. We've found that  lowering the barrier to triggering incident response has lead to a dramatic increase in the speed with which incidents are resolved .  We don't want people to sit on something because the official alarm hasn't gone off yet. If customer support gets lots of requests very quickly, it's a good sign there's something wrong, and we need them to be able to raise the alarm. We've even had interns trigger our incident response process in their first week. If the janitor walks past a graph and thinks it looks wrong, I want them to be able to trigger incident response.  We were initially hesitant to introduce this, as we feared it would lead to lots of false positives. People triggering the alarm in an abundance of caution and it not really being an incident. But we've seen quite the opposite, people are pretty good at policing this themselves.

The way we do incident response at PagerDuty isn\u2019t something we invented ourselves, it is heavily based on the  Incident Command System , usually abbreviated to ICS.  ICS was developed after some  devastating wildfires in Southern California  in 1970. Thousands of firefighters responded, but found it difficult to work together. They knew how to fight fires individually, but lacked a common framework to work effectively as a larger group.  After the fires, an interagency group called  FIRESCOPE  (Which believe it or not is an acronym for \"FIrefighting REsources of Southern California Organized for Potential Emergencies\") was formed and set out to develop two systems for managing wildland fire. One of those systems became known as ICS, and eventually became a national model for command structures at any major incident.  In 2004, the  National Incident Management System (NIMS)  was established by FEMA, and is now used as the standard for emergency management by all public agencies in the United States. NIMS defines several operational systems as part of it, of which ICS is one.  It\u2019s used by everyone from the local fire department responding to a house fire, to the US government responding to a natural disaster. It provides a standardized response framework that everyone is familiar with.  NIMS and ICS are the basis of the process we use at PagerDuty, however we have heavily modified it for our needs. Turns out that things can be streamlined a bit when human life isn't on the line.",

Docs Reference  It's worth noting that even though our process is based on the US systems, NIMS and ICS, there are many similar systems in use all over the world. While many are also based on ICS, some were developed separately, yet offer many of the same features.  I particularly like  the UK system , simply because it has a role called the \"Gold Commander\", which just sounds like a Bond villain.  When developing our process at PagerDuty, we looked at a few of the other systems in use around the world, and chose the bits we liked the most to add to our own.  Emergency Management Around the World If you're interested in learning more about the systems in use by other countries, we have  links to some official resources .

            "text": "016. Roles of incident response.  So let's talk about the  roles involved in our process . I'm going to introduce the roles one by one, but I don't want you to get scared by the number that will be on the slide by the end. We didn't start with this many roles, and we don't have people filling all the roles in every incident. This is just showing the available roles, and defining what they are. The process and roles will grow and shrink to fit the size of the incident at hand.  While we don\u2019t use exactly the same roles as ICS, we picked out the ones that matter for us in order to get our role structure.    First up is the  Incident Commander , usually abbreviated to IC. They're the person in charge and the most important role in the process. They make all the decisions, and all information flows up to them. What they say goes. I'm going to be talking more about this role in a moment, so we'll continue on with the others for now.    Next up we have the  Deputy . This is basically a backup Incident Commander. They're training as an IC and will be listening to all the same information. They help to make sure nothing gets missed by the IC, and acts as a hot-swap standby should the IC want to handover command. This is one of those roles you won't need if you're just starting out. For a long time our Deputy and Scribe would be the same person.    Then we have the  Scribe . The scribe's job is to keep an accurate timeline of events. What has happened, when it happened, and the key decisions that have been made. We use Slack for this, and the Scribe will be writing down notes into a Slack room, which gets us nicely timestamped data. It's worth noting that they're  not doing a direct dictation  of a voice call. It's not \"John said this, Mary said this\". It's more like \"We're deciding between A and B, we've decided on A\".    Together, these roles are called the Command Staff.    Next we have the  Customer Liaison . This is a member of our support team, and their job is to handle the two-way interaction with our customers. So they'll update customers as to what is going on, whether that's via email, tweet, or updating our status page. But they'll also let us know what customers are saying too. If we're getting 100's of support requests, or no one has raised a ticket at all. Since this can be useful information in tracking down a cause, and determining the level of risk we can take during our recovery.    The  Internal Liaison  is a relatively new role in our process. Their job is to handle all the interaction with internal teams, such as our executives, or our marketing teams, and so on. We have a separate Slack channel for incident updates, to which the Internal Liaison will post regular status updates, and answer any questions from the rest of the organization. This keeps those questions out of our main response, but allows people to still get answers. The internal liaison will also page other teams as necessary if they're needed on the response. Again, this isn't a role you'll need for most companies, for a while this was also handled by our Deputy/Scribe role.    Together, these are the liaisons.   Finally, we have the  Subject Matter Experts , or SME's. These are the people who will actually be fixing the problem. They'll be the ones logging into servers, changing code, and running commands.   Today, I\u2019m going to focus on one role in particular, that of the Incident Commander.",

What if you join a call and there's no IC? It doesn't always work out that the first person to join the call is the incident commander. So what do you do in that case? Some guides will recommend the first person who joins acts as the Incident Commander, regardless of training. ICS usually works this way, where the first person on-site acts as the IC until someone more qualified arrives. We tried that and found it just doesn't work in practice. For example, let's say that the first person to join your response call becomes the acting IC. After an incident occurs, how long do you think it will be before one of your responders joins the call?  Yeah, turns out it's about 10 minutes. Because people are afraid of being the IC. You can't force someone to be an IC, and we prefer to make sure the acting IC at least has the training. It may add a few minutes to the start of an incident, but it makes it go smoother and quicker overall. If a trained IC joins the call and there's isn't an existing IC, they will take on the role. They ask \"Is there an IC on the call?.... hearing nothing, this is X, I'm the Incident Commander\".  It's also worth noting that the on-call IC doesn't automatically take over when they join.

Avoid this at all costs.  Once handing over your role to someone else, you should leave the response call and all associated chat rooms. Take a break away from anything related to the incident.  You may be required to take the role again later if the incident is very long running.

Many people are hesitant to take on the responsibilities of being an IC in addition to their current work and on-call responsibilities, which is a perfectly valid concern. One of the best ways we found to increase the pool of Incident Commanders is to encourage folks outside of normal engineering teams to take on the role.

You don't want to be doing it for the first time during a real incident.  Reading about it is one thing, but going through the motions is very different.  Start by running mock incidents. Then treat your smaller incidents as if they're larger ones. If you trigger incident response and find it's not a real incident, treat it like one anyway since it's free practice.  At PagerDuty, we run something called  Failure Friday  where we purposefully inject failure into our systems to test their resilience. We treat this like a major incident, with an incident commander and everything. It allows us to practice while we're not under the stress of a normal incident.  We also play a game called  Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes . Yes, that's right, we play video games at work. But we've found that this game really helps to simulate a lot of the things an incident commander has to deal with, and is a great way to get some stress free practice.  The bottom line is to practice as much as you can, so that when you do have the inevitable incident, your response is just routine.",

In the meantime, the hope is that the descriptions on this page can help you to reproduce similar functionality with your own  tooling.\n\n\n\n\nIncident Response\n#\n\n\nOur \n!ic\n commands poll the PagerDuty API behind the scenes for various on-call schedules we specify.

It uses the cached schedule information and will page all of the current Incident Commanders on-call (the primary, the backup, and any trainees who are shadowing). It will also notify into the room if it is unable to page them for any reason, and direct users to manually call the person using their contact information. Additionally, it will create a new PagerDuty incident and link users to it.\n\n\n\n\nIf for any reason we are unable to page the Incident Commanders automatically, the bot will let us know that it has failed, and give us the phone numbers for the relevant people so we can manually call them. Here is some example output from our test bot, where we have simulated being unable to page via PagerDuty due to an unresponsive API call.\n\n\n\n\n!ic responders\n#\n\n\nThis works similarly to the \n!ic\n command, only it uses all our service team schedules instead of just the IC schedules. It will list out all the current people who are on-call for each engineering team. This is useful to also know who will likely be joining the incident call momentarily.\n\n\n\n\n!ic page responders\n#\n\n\nThis works similarly to \n!ic page\n, only it pages the responders list instead of the Incident Commanders. This is rarely used, since generally only the relevant team will get paged. However, sometimes we require an \"all hands on deck\" response, and need the ability to quickly page all the current on-calls.\n\n\n\n\n!ic who \nuser\n#\n\n\nSometimes we may need to identify a specific individual to bring them onto a call. This command lists out the contact info for a specific user, and a message telling users how to page them.\n\n\n\n\n!ic page \nuser\n#\n\n\nThis will page a specific person by username.\n\n\n\n\nStatus\n#\n\n\nOur \n!status\n commands look at our internal monitoring systems to determine the current system state, as reported by the systems themselves. This is the status our alerting tooling uses to automatically notify us of issues.\n\n\n!status\n#\n\n\nThis will tell us the current overview of our system state.

            "text": "Process Anti-Patterns\n\n\nThese are some processes that we've found do not work well. We've either tried them in the past and regretted it, or spent considerable time thinking about them and ultimately rejected them. We want to document them to make sure we don't repeat mistakes or wonder why a decision was made later down the line. The list is in no particular order.\n\n\n\n\nGetting everyone on the call.\n#\n\n\nBelieve it or not, we used to page every single engineer at PagerDuty when we had a SEV-2 incident. If a SEV-2 happened at 3am, then we'd be paging the entire engineering department at 3am. There a few reasons we went down this path,\n\n\n\n\nWhen the company was smaller, there were only a few engineers. So this process worked well, since you really did need every engineer on the call.\n\n\nRather than triaging an incident and then having to page in additional people, if everyone is on the call to begin with then the thinking was that we'd get a faster response.\n\n\n\n\nAs we grew our engineer department, this did not scale well at all, and problems quickly became apparent,\n\n\n\n\nMost of the people on the call had nothing to do. They'd been woken up for no reason.\n\n\nPaging people has a cost impact. Both in employee health, and in finance. Waking up your entire engineering department at 3am means nothing productive is going to be done the next day, across the entire department.\n\n\nPeople who weren't on-call would still get paged.\n\n\n\n\nIt's important to maintain an \neffective span of control\n on any incident response. If you have more than 7 or 8 people directly reporting to the \nIncident Commander\n things can quickly get overwhelming. We now will only page the engineers who are on-call for a specific service, rather than the entire team. If more responders are required, then they will be mobilized by the \nInternal Liaison\n to join the response. 9 times out of 10 we don't need additional responders, so the rest of the engineering department can get some rest without interference. This results in a happier engineering department and a more streamlined response process.\n\n\nForcing everyone to stay on the call.\n#\n\n\nOur original thinking was that if you've been mobilized onto a response call, then we would need you to stick around until the end, since if you were needed at one point, chances are you'll be needed again before the incident is resolved. Unfortunately, we've since found that that's never really the case. Typically someone will be mobilized to investigate a specific system, or perform a specific action, after which time there would be nothing further required from them. We'd have a call full of people who weren't doing anything and could've gone back to sleep. This can also encourage 'hero' mentalities where individuals feel pressured that they have to stay on a call.\n\n\nNow we ask people to leave the call if they're no longer needed. Once the Incident Commander has ascertained which systems are impacted, they let representatives for the other systems leave the call so they can get some rest. You can always mobilize them again if they're really needed. Most of the time they won't be needed again, so we're optimizing for the 99% case.\n\n\nToo frequent status updates.\n#\n\n\nExecutives need to know what's going on and want to be provided status updates every 5 minutes to keep them in the loop. The problem with this is that you'll spend the entire time providing status updates rather than resolving the incident.\n\n\nWe've found that providing status updates every 20-30 minutes during a major incident is a typical cadence that works. This ensures we're not just providing updates for the sake of providing updates, but that they're more likely to have some actual useful information in them. That's not to say you can't provide updates more frequently if there really is new information to share, but it shouldn't be a requirement. We want to spend as much time fixing the incident as we can, but we also want to make sure we keep stakeholders in the loop. It's a delicate balance that's easy to get wrong.\n\n\nAssuming silence means no progress.\n#\n\n\nIt can be common to assume silence on an incident call means that nothing is being done, however this is rarely the case. When joining a call, be aware that a chatterless session can be acceptable and reasonable. Silence usually means everyone is working on fixing the problem rather than talking and providing updates. We're not playing a game of \"Keep talking and nobody gets fired\". The Incident Commander is the one who should be doing most of the talking on a call. They will typically fill silence with a status update if appropriate, but others within the organization need to be trained to know that silence on a call isn't a bad thing, and doesn't mean that progress has stalled. Making sure staff are aware of this ahead of time will prevent awkward conversations during an incident call, which would be ultimately distracting from resolving the incident.\n\n\nLitigating severities during the incident call.\n#\n\n\nThe start of a lot of incident calls in PagerDuty's past consisted of a discussion around whether we were really in a SEV-2 situation, or whether it was a smaller issue that could be handled without an incident call. This discussion would usually take up quite a bit of time, as everyone wanted to weigh in. The problem was that while you're having this discussion, the incident is still going on behind the scenes, and by the time you've finished it has become a SEV-1 and you've just wasted 10 minutes discussing severities.\n\n\nWe now have a rule: \nWe do not discuss incident severity during an incident call\n, we always assume it's the higher severity and treat it as such. So if we're not sure if it's a SEV-2 or SEV-3, we treat it like a SEV-2 and move on. We've already spun up the gears of incident response and paged responders, so even if it turns out to be a SEV-3, we may as well continue with the process and treat it as practice if nothing else.\n\n\nHesitating to escalate to other responders.\n#\n\n\nIf it's 3am and you're responding to an incident, we have had cases where a Subject Matter Expert (SME) would be stuck attempting to debug an issue, and they would be reluctant to involve another member of their team due to the time of day. This would end up causing our incident to last longer than it needed to.\n\n\n\"Never hesitate to escalate\"\n is now one of our mantras. If you're stuck on a problem and it's 3am, don't hesitate to page someone more knowledgable to help resolve the situation. Don't go too far with this and page everyone, otherwise you fall into the earlier anti-pattern. But you should never feel like you can't page someone if you need help.\n\n\nDiscussing process and policy decisions during the incident call.\n#\n\n\nThere are occasions where responders don't agree with the incident response policies and processes we might use. Sometimes this will cause a discussion during the incident call, which ends up derailing the process for everyone and causing the underlying incident to last longer, hindering the response. It is absolutely OK to have disagreements with the process and to want to make changes (in fact, this is something we encourage, as it allows us to iteratively improve our process), however during an incident is not the time to have that discussion.\n\n\nPolicy and processes should not be discussed during an incident\n, just like with severities. The current process should be followed during an incident, and any concerns should be raised afterwards, either during a post-mortem or directly to the team managing the incident response process.\n\n\nNeglecting the post-mortem and followup activities.\n#\n\n\nIt's tempting once an incident is resolved to not bother with the post-mortem. Either you feel like the cause is well known, or you don't feel that it's worth it. Don't fall into this trap! A post-mortem is always worthwhile. People were mobilized to respond to an incident, which had a cost associated with it. We want to be sure that we understand why that happened, so we can avoid that cost in future.\n\n\nDon't make the mistake of neglecting a post-mortem after an incident. Without a post-mortem you fail to recognize what you're doing right, where you could improve, and most importantly, how to avoid making the same exact mistakes next time around. A well-designed, blameless post-mortem allows teams to continuously learn, and serves as a way to iteratively improve your infrastructure and incident response process.\n\n\nIf you mobilize responders and determine it's not a \"real\" incident, you should still conduct a post-mortem. Because the next time you're going to mobilize responders again and waste time. Find out why incident response was triggered when it may not have been needed, and fix that problem.\n\n\nBeing too focussed on the problem in front of you.\n#\n\n\nAs a responder to an incident, you would typically be focussed on the specific task in front of you. The Incident Commander generally being the person who has the bigger picture of what is going on. There can be a tendency for SME's to become too focussed on the problem they see in front of them, rather than taking the bigger picture into account. This usually presents itself on an incident call with an SME constantly bringing up the same issue without listening to instructions from the incident commander, and having tunnel vision for the specific issue on their system.\n\n\nInstructions from the Incident Commander should always be followed, as they will typically have more overall context on what is going on. Try not to fall into the trap of being hyper-focused on the problem in front of you, so much so that you derail the process. We want to treat the cause, not a symptom of the incident.\n\n\nBeing averse to policy and process changes.\n#\n\n\nOnce a stable process is in place, and incidents are getting resolved, there can be lots of hesitation and resistance to changing that process. \"If it ain't broke don't fix it\", etc. As your company grows, your response will need to change. Holding on to your old processes and practices for too long can hinder your incident response going forward. Don't be reckless, of course, but try to introduce sensible changes and \ndon't be afraid to make changes which might slow things down in the short-term, but will make things faster in the long-run\n. These are the hardest changes to make, but usually the most worthwhile.\n\n\nTrying to take on multiple roles.\n#\n\n\nIn past PagerDuty incidents, we've had instances where the Incident Commander has started to assume the Subject Matter Expert role and attempted to solve the problem themselves. This usually happens when the IC is an engineer in their day-to-day role. They are in an incident where the cause appears to be a system they know very well and have the requisite knowledge to fix. Wanting to solve the incident quickly, the IC will start to try and solve the problem. Sometimes you might get lucky and it will resolve the incident, but most of the time the immediately visible issue isn't necessarily the underlying cause of the incident. By the time that becomes apparent, you have an Incident Commander who is not paying attention to the other systems and is just focussed on the one problem in front of them. This effectively means there's no incident commander, as they would be busy trying to fix the problem. Inevitably, the problem turns out to be much bigger than anticipated and the response has become completely derailed.\n\n\nYou cannot take on another role at the same time as being an Incident Commander\n. It can be a difficult to be an IC when you want to jump in as an SME, but you must resist the temptation to abandon the role of IC. If you really are the only person able to solve the problem, you should handover to another Incident Commander and then assume the role of SME. This ensures that the response process remains on track with a dedicated Incident Commander.\n\n\nRemember that the job of an IC also includes preparing backup plans in case the current action doesn't resolve the incident. If you're acting as an SME fixing on a particular issue, you're not considering the backup plan.\n\n\nTrying to be a hero.\n#\n\n\nIt can be tempting to try and solve every issue yourself if you're acting as a Subject Matter Expert. Every request that comes up, you want to jump on it and say you'll take care of it. You'll be the indispensable one who solves all the problems. As noble as the intent is, it rarely leads to an efficient outcome. You want to avoid as much multi-tasking as possible during an incident, and focus on one problem at a time. \nDon't try to solve everything yourself\n. If multiple requests are coming up for your area of expertise, delegate them to other experts, even paging backup responders if required.\n\n\nLikewise, if another SME has been assigned a task, don't do the task on their behalf without consulting with them first. While you are trying to help, it will end up hindering the response as you'll have two people working on the same issue, and they may be interfering with each other in unexpected ways.\n\n\nNot disseminating policy changes to responders.\n#\n\n\nWe've fallen into the trap in the past of making policy and process changes by simply updating our internal documentation (i.e. this), assuming everyone would read the documentation before an incident. Which of course, never happens.\n\n\nAny policy changes need to be appropriately disseminated to your responders ahead of time\n so that there are no surprises during an incident. This can be in the form of an email, or an update into a chat room, but big policy changes should never be a surprise to responders.\n\n\nRequiring Incident Commanders to have deep technical knowledge.\n#\n\n\nThis is a trap we fell into in our early days of incident response. We had several strong technical requirements for any new Incident Commanders, aiming to only have IC's with deep technical expertise, the intention being that they could diagnose issues very quickly. When it became apparent that we would need a large selection of IC's in order to maintain an effective on-call rotation, we soon realised that we had artificially restricted our pool of potential IC candidates.\n\n\nIncident Commanders can come from all across your organization, and don't need to be technical experts\n. Since Incident Commanders only coordinate the response, they don't need deep technical knowledge of the system in order to perform their role. The Subject Matter Experts are the ones who need the deep technical knowledge. The Incident Commanders only require a high-level knowledge of how the system works. Where data flows in, how systems use it, and where data flows out. The technical details can be left to the SMEs, with the IC asking relevant questions.\n\n\nBy dropping our strong technical requirements for Incident Commanders, we've been able to dramatically increase our pool of IC's, maintain a high level of quality and efficiency in our response, and help spread empathy for on-call workload to a larger portion of the company.",

If a SEV-2 happened at 3am, then we'd be paging the entire engineering department at 3am. There a few reasons we went down this path,   When the company was smaller, there were only a few engineers. So this process worked well, since you really did need every engineer on the call.  Rather than triaging an incident and then having to page in additional people, if everyone is on the call to begin with then the thinking was that we'd get a faster response.   As we grew our engineer department, this did not scale well at all, and problems quickly became apparent,   Most of the people on the call had nothing to do. They'd been woken up for no reason.  Paging people has a cost impact. Both in employee health, and in finance. Waking up your entire engineering department at 3am means nothing productive is going to be done the next day, across the entire department.  People who weren't on-call would still get paged.   It's important to maintain an  effective span of control  on any incident response. If you have more than 7 or 8 people directly reporting to the  Incident Commander  things can quickly get overwhelming. We now will only page the engineers who are on-call for a specific service, rather than the entire team. If more responders are required, then they will be mobilized by the  Internal Liaison  to join the response. 9 times out of 10 we don't need additional responders, so the rest of the engineering department can get some rest without interference. This results in a happier engineering department and a more streamlined response process.",

Unfortunately, we've since found that that's never really the case. Typically someone will be mobilized to investigate a specific system, or perform a specific action, after which time there would be nothing further required from them. We'd have a call full of people who weren't doing anything and could've gone back to sleep. This can also encourage 'hero' mentalities where individuals feel pressured that they have to stay on a call.  Now we ask people to leave the call if they're no longer needed. Once the Incident Commander has ascertained which systems are impacted, they let representatives for the other systems leave the call so they can get some rest. You can always mobilize them again if they're really needed. Most of the time they won't be needed again, so we're optimizing for the 99% case.",

The problem with this is that you'll spend the entire time providing status updates rather than resolving the incident.  We've found that providing status updates every 20-30 minutes during a major incident is a typical cadence that works. This ensures we're not just providing updates for the sake of providing updates, but that they're more likely to have some actual useful information in them. That's not to say you can't provide updates more frequently if there really is new information to share, but it shouldn't be a requirement.

We're not playing a game of \"Keep talking and nobody gets fired\". The Incident Commander is the one who should be doing most of the talking on a call. They will typically fill silence with a status update if appropriate, but others within the organization need to be trained to know that silence on a call isn't a bad thing, and doesn't mean that progress has stalled. Making sure staff are aware of this ahead of time will prevent awkward conversations during an incident call, which would be ultimately distracting from resolving the incident.",

The problem was that while you're having this discussion, the incident is still going on behind the scenes, and by the time you've finished it has become a SEV-1 and you've just wasted 10 minutes discussing severities.  We now have a rule:  We do not discuss incident severity during an incident call , we always assume it's the higher severity and treat it as such. So if we're not sure if it's a SEV-2 or SEV-3, we treat it like a SEV-2 and move on. We've already spun up the gears of incident response and paged responders, so even if it turns out to be a SEV-3, we may as well continue with the process and treat it as practice if nothing else.",
